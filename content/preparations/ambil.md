# Ambil (Traditional Amazonian Tobacco Paste)

**Ambil** is a concentrated tobacco preparation central to the ceremonial and social practices of Amazonian Indigenous peoples, notably the Tukano, Witoto, and Bora.  
Produced from *Nicotiana rustica* (mapacho) leaves slowly reduced into a dark, viscous resin, ambil embodies the **word**, complementing **[mambe](./mambe.md)**, the **thought**.

## 1 · Botanical Composition

*Nicotiana rustica* contains 2–14 % nicotine—five to ten times stronger than commercial tobacco—and trace alkaloids such as nornicotine and anabasine.  
Leaves are harvested at maturity, smoke-free dried, and stored for ritual reduction.  
Its potency and sacred status make it the principal “teacher plant” of dialogue and clarity across the Northwest Amazon.

## 2 · Preparation Process

1. **Extraction:** Leaves simmer in water for hours or days, releasing alkaloids.  
2. **Reduction:** The infusion is gently evaporated until thick and black.  
3. **Ash Admixture:** Alkaline ash—often from *Cecropia* or *Theobroma bicolor*—is added to free nicotine base and enhance absorption.  
4. **Ceremonial Infusion:** Throughout, prayer and song infuse the paste with intention and ancestral power.

The result is a glossy black resin kept in small containers and used sparingly during dialogue sessions.

## 3 · Traditional and Ceremonial Roles

In the *maloca*, ambil represents **speech, water, and expression**, while **mambe** represents **thought, earth, and reflection**.  
Consumed together, they enact the cosmic duality of silence / word and feminine / masculine energies.  

Ambil facilitates:
- clear, honest communication during community deliberations,  
- storytelling and knowledge transmission,  
- emotional regulation and mediation,  
- grounding and attentiveness for shamans and leaders.

## 4 · Pharmacology and Effects

Nicotine absorbed through the oral mucosa acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, enhancing dopamine and acetylcholine signaling.  
The result is *alert calm*: sustained attention, vocal clarity, emotional equilibrium, and strengthened presence.  
Cultural context and dosage prevent addiction; the medicine functions as a cognitive and spiritual modulator rather than a stimulant drug.

---

## 5 · Legal and Ethical Context

While tobacco is regulated globally, *Nicotiana rustica* enjoys ceremonial exemptions under Indigenous rights frameworks (CBD, Nagoya Protocol, UNDRIP).  
UNESCO recognizes the **mambe-ambil dialogue** within the *maloca* as intangible cultural heritage vital to Amazonian identity.  

Respectful engagement requires:
- Indigenous sovereignty and benefit-sharing,  
- avoidance of commercialization outside context,  
- protection of sacred preparation knowledge.

---

## 6 · Conservation and Continuity

Preserving *N. rustica* landraces ensures both genetic diversity and ceremonial continuity.  
Indigenous communities safeguard seeds in local banks, integrate tobacco into forest-garden agroforestry, and transmit preparation knowledge through **maloca-based education** and youth programs.
