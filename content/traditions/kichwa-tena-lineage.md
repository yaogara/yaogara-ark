## Abstract
This article surveys the ethnobotanical and anthropological dimensions of teacher plants in the Kichwa lineage of Tena, Ecuador—emphasizing the ceremonial and therapeutic roles of forest healers (Yachak), plant dietas, and the ritual applications of tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and guayusa (Ilex guayusa). Situated in the Upper Napo region, Kichwa practices encode complex knowledge regarding plant selection, preparation, and meaning, including the daily and ceremonial use of stimulant and protective plants and the apprenticeship structures that sustain them. These practices are dynamically maintained through family lineages, intercultural health initiatives, and evolving agroforestry systems amid ecological and social change (Cruz et al. 2023)[1][2]. Tobacco is central to cleansing, diagnosis, and protection, while guayusa anchors dawn gatherings, dreamwork, and communal vitality. The Kichwa pharmacopoeia remains diverse and adaptive, linking biocultural conservation with the continuity of healer knowledge (Cano et al. 2023; Schultes et al. 2001)[4][5].

## Botanical Classification
The Kichwa of the Upper Napo, particularly around Tena (Napo Province, Ecuador), maintain a rich pharmacopeia of forest and garden plants used for healing, protection, stamina, and divination (Cruz et al. 2023)[1]. Among these, tobacco and guayusa are culturally prominent:

- Tobacco (Nicotiana spp.)
  - Family: Solanaceae
  - Representative species: [[Nicotiana rustica]], [[Nicotiana tabacum]]
  - Habit and forms: herbaceous annuals or short-lived perennials; both wild and cultivated morphotypes are recognized and maintained for distinct ritual and therapeutic applications. In ritual, tobacco is frequently prepared as cigars known as [[mapacho]] or as liquid infusions and snuffs (Chirif et al. 2017)[3].

- Guayusa ([[Ilex guayusa]])
  - Family: Aquifoliaceae
  - Habit: evergreen shrub to small tree
  - Distribution: native to Amazonian Ecuador and adjacent Andean foothills; propagated in household and forest gardens; leaves are prepared as a caffeinated infusion for dawn gatherings and dreamwork (Cano et al. 2023).

Other salient medicinal plants recorded in the Upper Napo Kichwa pharmacopoeia include:
- [[Croton lechleri]] (Euphorbiaceae), a resin-producing tree (“dragon’s blood”) valued for wound care and infections.
- [[Uncaria tomentosa]] (Rubiaceae), a woody vine used for inflammatory conditions and chronic complaints.
- [[Erythrina amazonica]] (Fabaceae), cited for fatigue and sedative properties within constrained ritual protocols.

Kichwa botanical knowledge is embedded in forest management and swidden agroforestry mosaics, where mature forest gardens and chacras host both cultivated and semi-wild lineages of these species, reflecting longstanding practices of selection, exchange, and in situ conservation (Cruz et al. 2023)[1][2].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
The Kichwa lineage of Tena is situated in the Upper Napo region of the Ecuadorian Amazon, spanning riverine landscapes and terra firme uplands around the city of Tena and surrounding rural communities. This region lies at the interface of lowland Amazonia and Andean piedmont, with high rainfall, complex fluvial dynamics, and steep ecological gradients that support exceptional plant diversity. Healer-knowledge is closely tied to this mosaic of habitats:

- Riverine and floodplain zones support fast-growing secondary vegetation and facilitate transport and exchange of plant materials.
- Terra firme forests host canopy and understory species used for medicines, including bark and latex sources like [[Croton lechleri]].
- Forest gardens and swidden fallows provide semi-domesticated stands of [[Ilex guayusa]] and tobacco, maintained through cycles of planting, selective harvesting, and successional management typical of Amazonian agroforestry.

Kichwa households commonly maintain guayusa near dwellings and along footpaths for daily access, while tobacco is cultivated in garden plots or sourced from wild and semi-wild stands according to ritual requirements (Cruz et al. 2023)[1]. The spatial organization of these plants reflects both ecological suitability (light, soil moisture) and cultural logics of proximity, ritual purity, and control over plant “persons,” including the social protocols for approaching, harvesting, and preparing them.

## Ethnobotanical Context
Forest Yachak mediate relationships with teacher plants through dietas—structured periods of focused ingestion, dietary restriction, and isolation oriented toward learning from plants as sentient agents and kin. These practices resonate with broader Amazonian healing logics, where plant spirits, diagnostic trance, and song are central to therapeutic efficacy and the acquisition of knowledge (Cruz et al. 2023)[1][2]. Within the Tena lineage:

- Tobacco performs boundary work. Healers blow smoke to demarcate ritual space, cleanse patients, seal dietas, and carry intention. The smoke’s trajectory and sensory qualities may also inform diagnostic reading. Tobacco is understood as a protective ally that clarifies perception and repels intrusive forces (Chirif et al. 2017; Schultes et al. 2001)[3][5].
- Guayusa anchors dawn sociality. Prepared as a dark infusion, it supports wakefulness, storytelling, and the communal interpretation of dreams, which provide guidance for daily activities, interpersonal relations, and ritual timing. In extended practice, guayusa supports fasting, attentional focus, and dream recall for individual healers and apprentices (Schultes et al. 2001)[5].

Teacher-plant relations are expressed in kinship metaphors and linguistic tropes—plants are addressed as elder persons or teachers with preferred times, songs, and offerings (Cruz et al. 2023)[1][2]. Apprenticeship often begins within kin networks, where novices accompany elders into forest and garden settings to learn plant identification, proper harvest techniques, and ritual speech. Women and men may both become healers, though roles and specializations vary by community.

Beyond tobacco and guayusa, Kichwa pharmacopoeia includes latex, bark, root, and leaf medicines for infections, tumors, chronic fatigue, and postpartum care, drawing on a repertoire of over 80 documented species in the Upper Napo (Cruz et al. 2023)[1]. Ethnobiological knowledge is interconnected: studies of Kichwa ethnotaxonomy and resource management indicate fine-grained classificatory systems that guide sustainable use across plant and animal domains, reinforcing social-ecological stewardship (Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 2022)[7].

Contemporary practice is adaptive. Healers incorporate biomedical diagnostics where useful, and some participate in regional markets for herbal products, while maintaining ethical boundaries around ritual knowledge and plant-person relationships. Youth engagement fluctuates under acculturation pressures, yet remains resilient where community institutions, intercultural health programs, and cultural heritage initiatives support local sovereignty over knowledge and land (Cruz et al. 2023; NIH, 2023)[1][2][6].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
The pharmacology of Kichwa teacher plants reflects a balance of stimulant, protective, and cleansing actions within ritual frameworks:

- Tobacco (Nicotiana spp.)
  - Principal alkaloid: nicotine; minor alkaloids include anatabine and others (Schultes et al. 2001)[5].
  - Neuropharmacology: nicotine is a potent agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, producing cognitive stimulation, increased attentional focus, appetite suppression, and modulation of sensory processing. In higher ritual doses or concentrated preparations, effects may include nausea and purgation, interpreted within Kichwa frameworks as cleansing and energetic alignment (Schultes et al. 2001; Chirif et al. 2017)[3][5].
  - Symbolism: tobacco’s “heat” and penetrating smoke are associated with protection, clarity, and boundary-making. Its directed exhalation (soplar) concentrates intention, enabling diagnosis and intervention by the Yachak (Chirif et al. 2017)[3].

- Guayusa (Ilex guayusa)
  - Principal constituents: caffeine; minor methylxanthines including theobromine and theophylline (Cano et al. 2023)[4].
  - Neuropharmacology: adenosine receptor antagonism promotes wakefulness, vigilance, and mild euphoria; synergistic effects with theobromine may modulate cardiovascular tone and mood. In Kichwa practice, these properties support predawn wakefulness and enhanced dream recall during communal interpretation (Cano et al. 2023; Schultes et al. 2001)[4][5].
  - Symbolism: guayusa bridges individual cognition and communal exchange—connecting the dream world to daytime coordination, hunting, gardening, and relational ethics.

Together, tobacco and guayusa are conceptualized as teacher species with distinct “personalities” and domains of action, addressed through songs, offerings, dietary restrictions, and conduct codes that shape their effects. The pharmacological actions are not isolated from their ritual ecologies; rather, they are interpreted through social relations with plant persons and place (Cruz et al. 2023)[1][2].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Preparation and administration reflect careful sequencing, ritual timing, and respect for plant agency:

- Tobacco
  - Cultivation and harvest: selective planting in garden plots; leaves harvested at maturity; sun-dried and cured.
  - Forms: rolled cigars (mapacho), snuff, and liquid preparations for oral or nasal ingestion, with dosage and vehicle adjusted to ritual purpose (cleansing, protection, diagnostic trance) (Chirif et al. 2017)[3].
  - Ceremony: healers blow smoke around patients, objects, and spaces to demarcate ritual boundaries and seal dietas; vaporization and directed exhalation may accompany song and prayer. In intensive dietas, tobacco can be ingested in isolation under supervision to deepen visionary learning and cultivate protective alliances (Chirif et al. 2017; Schultes et al. 2001)[3][5].

- Guayusa
  - Harvest and preparation: fresh leaves are lightly dried and steeped into a dark infusion with variable strength; emberside decoction at dawn is common.
  - Use contexts: communal predawn gatherings center on storytelling and the recapitulation of dreams for guidance; individual practitioners may consume stronger preparations during fasting or periods of heightened ritual activity (Schultes et al. 2001)[5].

- Dietas
  - Protocols: supervised by elder Yachak, dietas focus on one plant at a time, with restrictions on salt, fats, and social contact; periods may last days to weeks. Songs (ikaros), prayers, and offerings align the participant with the plant’s domain of action and protect against adverse influences.
  - Transmission: apprentices complete multiple dietas, learning precise selection, dosing, and integration, and cultivating discernment for when plants should be combined or kept apart (Cruz et al. 2023)[1][2].

Other medicinal preparations in the Upper Napo include resinous latex applications, bark decoctions, and leaf poultices for infections, injuries, and chronic fatigue, reflecting a flexible repertoire suited to household and ceremonial care (Cruz et al. 2023)[1]. Documentation and collaborative research efforts have cataloged these practices and their taxonomic foundations, supporting cultural continuity and scientific cross-verification (Cano et al. 2023; Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 2022)[4][7].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
The resilience of Kichwa plant medicine depends on biocultural conservation: safeguarding forests and waterways, supporting Indigenous land tenure, and upholding community authority over ceremonial knowledge and plant access. Ethical and practical considerations include:

- Biocultural rights: recognize Kichwa stewardship and intellectual property in medicinal plant traditions, ensuring that research and commercialization do not extract or misrepresent knowledge (Cruz et al. 2023)[1][2].
- Cultural respect: avoid commodification or superficial appropriation of ceremonies; support culturally led education and healer associations that define proper contexts for practice.
- Sustainability: maintain agroforestry plots and forest gardens that propagate [[Ilex guayusa]], tobacco, and rarer medicinals; observe harvest rotations and species-specific protocols; develop market access for sustainably grown guayusa that centers community governance (Schultes et al. 2001; Cano et al. 2023)[4][5].
- Consent and documentation: ensure prior informed consent, co-authorship where appropriate, and benefit-sharing mechanisms in research, publications, and product development (Cruz et al. 2023; NIH, 2023)[1][2][6].

Legal frameworks in Ecuador partially protect Indigenous medicinal practices and territories, yet external pressures—resource extraction, infrastructure, and tourism markets—pose risks to both biodiversity and cultural integrity. Cross-community initiatives and ethnobiological archives help consolidate knowledge and strengthen youth engagement, including documentation beyond plant medicines into broader Kichwa ethnotaxonomy and foodways (Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 2022; SAGE, 2023)[7][8]. In the Upper Napo, the continuity of teacher-plant lineages remains closely tied to forest conservation, language vitality, and the autonomy of Yachak lineages to define appropriate transmission and ceremonial use (Cruz et al. 2023)[1][2].
