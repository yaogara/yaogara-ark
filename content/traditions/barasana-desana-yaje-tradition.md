## Abstract
The use of yajé ([[ayahuasca]]) features centrally in the spiritual and social lives of the Barasana and Desana, Eastern Tukanoan peoples of the Northwest Amazon. Their yajé tradition is intricately linked to cosmological narratives, notably creation myths involving language and ancestry, and is expressed through highly codified ritual, social organization, and mythopoetic transmission. These practices, which persist in isolated maloca communities, are fundamental for knowledge transmission, social cohesion, and the protection of cultural and biological heritage in the region (Wright 1998; Davis 2020)[1][4].

## Botanical Classification
Yajé, in the Barasana–Desana context, is a ceremonial decoction. Its pharmacological core is formed by a β-carboline–rich liana combined with DMT-containing leaf admixtures. The primary taxa involved include:

- Banisteriopsis caapi (principal vine)
  - Common names: yagé/yajé vine, caapi
  - Family: Malpighiaceae
  - Genus: Banisteriopsis
  - Species: Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C.V. Morton
  - Role: Source of harmala alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine), conferring monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibition and intrinsic psychoactivity (Schultes & Raffauf 1992)[8].

- Psychotria viridis (common leaf admixture)
  - Common names: chacruna
  - Family: Rubiaceae
  - Genus: Psychotria
  - Species: Psychotria viridis Ruiz & Pav.
  - Role: Source of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), rendered orally active in the presence of MAO-A inhibitors from the vine (Schultes & Hofmann 1992)[8].

Regional variation in admixtures is documented across Eastern Tukanoan groups and neighboring peoples, yet the Barasana and Desana preparations consistently center on [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] with leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]] or analogous DMT-bearing taxa to achieve the canonical synergism of the brew (Schultes & Raffauf 1992; Labate & Cavnar 2014)[6][8].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
The Barasana and Desana inhabit the Pirá-piraná river basin and adjacent sub-basins between the Vaupés and Japurá rivers, straddling the Colombian Vaupés Department and the Brazilian state of Amazonas (Jackson 1983; Wikipedia 2023)[2][4]. Settlement patterns are organized around communal longhouses (malocas) situated along upland interfluvial forests and secondary waterways, embedded within a mosaic of terra firme rainforest, riverine corridors, and gardens. This ecological setting supports the cultivation or stewardship of yajé vines and admixture plants within forest fallows and near-household agroforestry plots, while also enabling controlled access to wild stands through customary territorial protocols (Jackson 1983)[2].

Ethnolinguistically, both groups belong to the Eastern Tukanoan language family, with notable dialectal continuity across neighboring groups (e.g., Taiwano, Wanano, Siriano). This intercomprehension underpins shared ritual repertoires, mythic geographies, and exchange networks, facilitating the circulation of yajé knowledge and ceremonial forms across river basins (Chernela 2012; eHRAF 2023)[2][5]. Persistent geographical isolation, enforced by difficult terrain and sociolinguistic exogamy rules, has historically buffered ritual life against external pressures, sustaining distinctive Barasana–Desana ceremonial ecologies (PIB Socioambiental)[4].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Within Barasana and Desana societies, yajé is understood as a “teacher plant” and a medium of knowledge transmission, memory, and moral order. Ritual ingestion is a controlled practice linked to male initiation, shamanic offices, and interclan diplomacy. Participation is governed by lineage, age-grade, and ritual competency; women’s roles, though often marked by spatial and temporal separation during ceremonies, are integral within broader Eastern Tukanoan social systems and the maintenance of domestic and agricultural life that undergirds ritual cycles (Jackson 1983; eHRAF 2023)[2][5].

Cosmologically, yajé-powered ceremonies reenact foundational episodes from the time of creation. Central among these is the journey of the Anaconda ancestor along the rivers, which established the ordering of space, time, and social divisions (exogamous phratries, clan hierarchies, marriage rules). Through myth-chants, dance, and the disciplined visioning enabled by yajé, participants retrace ancestral itineraries, reasserting the bonds between named places, ritual prerogatives, and lineage histories (Davis 2020)[1]. These performances do not merely recall the past; they are creative acts that regenerate the world and re-inscribe the social contracts between humans and non-human entities.

A defining philosophical distinction in Barasana thought contrasts “mind-seeing” with the “eye-seeing” attributed to outsiders. Through ritual preparation and the ingestion of yajé, the expert sees with the mind, accessing structures, relations, and beings veiled to uninitiated vision. This epistemology frames yajé not as intoxication but as disciplined perception, where song-texts, flute sequences, feather regalia, and body painting are technologies of transformation that align the participant with beings from mythic time (Davis 2020)[1]. Yajé is thus a linguistic and semiotic vehicle—an instrument that discloses and regenerates the primordial language, the ordering principle by which beings, rivers, houses, and kin categories came to be differentiated and harmonized. Ritual usage simultaneously reaffirms group identity, orders hierarchies, and marks social boundaries, maintaining the cyclical flow of life energy and cosmic balance (Wright 1998)[1].

While yajé use is widespread among more than 160 Indigenous groups across the Amazon, the Barasana–Desana complex is noted for its emphasis on language creation, mythic geography, and the tightly coupled relation between ceremonial discourse and social reproduction (Labate & Cavnar 2014)[6]. These features anchor yajé as both a pharmacological and a semiotic system—one that integrates plant teachers, ritual specialists, and landscape into a coherent practice of world-making.

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
The classical pharmacology of yajé involves a reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) by β-carboline alkaloids from [[Banisteriopsis caapi]]—principally harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine—permitting the oral activity of DMT supplied by admixture leaves such as [[Psychotria viridis]] (Schultes & Hofmann 1992)[8]. In isolation, DMT is rapidly deactivated via first-pass metabolism; in the presence of MAO-A inhibition, it becomes systemically available, yielding a visionary state that is stabilized and modulated by the β-carboline matrix.

Beyond enabling DMT, harmala alkaloids exert intrinsic psychoactive effects, including tremorogenic, somatosensory, and cognitive influences, and are reported to contribute to the characteristic timing and tonal qualities of yajé visions and acoustemologies. Ethnographically, these states are “tuned” by ritual form—dietary restrictions, the cadence of myth-chants, and the rhythmic organization of collective singing and dancing—which scaffold attention, memory, and affect (Schultes & Hofmann 1992; Davis 2020)[1][8]. For the Barasana and Desana, pharmacology and poetics are not separable domains: the brew’s chemistry provides necessary conditions, but full realization of “mind-seeing” depends on correct performance, lineage-specific knowledge, and the presence of ritual guardians.

Symbolically, the Barasana–Desana tradition construes yajé as a linguistic mechanism, a means of “hearing” and “speaking” the primordial language from which human languages and ritual roles derive. Mythically, ancestral beings ingested yajé to create, differentiate, and harmonize human groups, bestowing each with its proper language, ornaments, and territories; ceremonies mirror and renew this differentiation, maintaining cosmic order (Davis 2020)[1]. In this framework, pharmacological effects become semiotic practices that index ancestry and territory, while social structure is continually reanimated through visionary verification.

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Preparation follows a highly ritualized sequence. Mature vines of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] are harvested with chants and prohibitions, scraped, pounded, and layered in a large pot with freshly collected leaves of admixture plants, commonly [[Psychotria viridis]]. The mixture is boiled for hours, often reduced and reboiled, until a thick, brown decoction is obtained. Throughout, elders or shamans oversee the process, regulating speech, diet, and comportment to ensure the brew’s strength and rectitude (Schultes 1972)[8]. The vessel, hearth, and implements are treated as beings with whom the specialists maintain respectful relations.

Ceremonial protocols are conducted in the communal maloca under the leadership of initiated ritual experts. Participation requires adherence to dietary taboos, sexual abstinence, and periods of preparatory isolation. Roles are assigned by clan lineage and age-grade, encompassing chiefs, shamans, dancers, singers, and attendants (Jackson 1983; Davis 2020)[1][2]. These roles correspond to mythic offices established during the Anaconda ancestor’s journey and are recognized across Eastern Tukanoan networks (PIB Socioambiental)[4].

The performance architecture centers on myth-chants that recount migratory routes, named sites, and ancestral acts; collective singing and dancing align movement with the heartbeat of the house and the river; and the ingestion of yajé proceeds in measured rounds. Regalia—feather crowns, body painting, rattles, and flutes—materializes transformation, allowing dancers to embody beings from creation time (Davis 2020)[1]. The night proceeds through phases of silence and song, opening windows for “mind-seeing” under a disciplined, protective framework.

Knowledge transmission is guarded and cumulative. Elders train younger men over years, imparting plant lore, song repertoires, mythic maps, and ethics. Instruction covers precise botanical recognition of vine varieties, harvest timing, admixture selection, and the semiotics of color, sound, and ornament. Although male initiation defines many ritual prerogatives, women’s expertise is indispensable in horticulture, food preparation, childrearing, and the reproduction of daily life that supports ritual continuity (Jackson 1983; eHRAF 2023)[2][5]. Isolation provided by terrain, language taboos, and controlled marriage alliances has aided the endurance of these practices, even as syncretic adjustments—new ceremonial forms, engagement with health services, and protective legal strategies—shape contemporary transmission (Chernela 2012)[5].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Biocultural integrity in the Barasana–Desana region faces pressures from external incursions, bioprospecting, and cultural commodification. Recognition of collective intellectual property, ritual sovereignty, and territorial rights is central to sustaining both knowledge systems and biodiversity (Chernela 2012; Chacruna 2017)[3][6]. In 2011, the “Traditional knowledge of the jaguar shamans of [[Yuruparí]]”—a framework in which yajé is central—was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, bolstering efforts to preserve and transmit ritual knowledge (UNESCO 2011)[3].

Ecological sustainability is embedded in customary stewardship. Harvest of vines and admixtures follows ritual regulation, observance of closed seasons, and respect for the agency of plant and animal kin. These practices, coupled with small-scale, kin-managed agroforests and careful garden-forest mosaics, mitigate overexploitation. Continued external demand—for biomedical research, spiritual tourism, and global markets—risks misappropriation, dilution of ritual form, and ecological strain (Davis 2020)[1]. Community-led governance and territorial integrity are the most effective safeguards.

Ethical collaboration requires free, prior, and informed consent; equitable benefit-sharing; and acknowledgment of Indigenous authorship and ownership over ritual texts, images, and plant knowledge. International frameworks such as the Nagoya Protocol, along with regional and national legal instruments, provide standards for access and benefit-sharing that should be honored in all research, conservation, and dissemination initiatives (Labate & Cavnar 2014)[6]. For archivists and researchers, adherence to community protocols—including restrictions on recording, publication, and circulation of sensitive materials—is essential to maintaining trust and preventing harm.
