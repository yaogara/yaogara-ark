## Abstract
Banisteriopsis caapi, ubiquitous as the principal component of the [[ayahuasca]] brew, is a liana of central cultural and pharmacological significance in Amazonian ethnobotany. Its β-carboline alkaloids are essential in facilitating the oral activity of DMT from companion plants, underpinning its role as a “teacher plant” among Indigenous and mestizo communities. This article synthesizes current knowledge on taxonomy, morphology, distribution, traditional and contemporary uses, phytochemistry, ceremonial contexts, and the ethical and conservation challenges emerging alongside its global diffusion [1][2][4].

## Botanical Classification
Taxonomy  
- Kingdom: Plantae  
- Clade: Eudicots — Rosids  
- Order: Malpighiales  
- Family: Malpighiaceae  
- Genus: Banisteriopsis  
- Species: Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C.V.Morton [1][2][3][6][8]

Morphology  
- Growth form: A robust, perennial woody climber (liana) that commonly ascends 20–30 m into the forest canopy by twining around trees and lianas for support [1][3].  
- Stems and bark: Mature stems are characteristically chocolate-brown, with a smooth exterior; certain cultivated and wild morphotypes exhibit notable surface ridging and “knotted” or sinuose internodes (e.g., the caupuri type), distinctions that Indigenous experts correlate with differing ceremonial uses [1][4].  
- Leaves: Opposite, entire-margined, elliptic-ovate leaves typically 8–18 cm long and 3.5–8 cm wide, with short petioles and glabrous to sparsely pubescent surfaces depending on age and condition [3].  
- Inflorescences and flowers: Axillary or terminal cymose panicles; flowers are small (ca. 12–14 mm diameter), with pale pink to whitish petals and the characteristic Malpighiaceous floral architecture [1][3].  
- Fruits: Samaroid (winged) nuts, typically three-winged schizocarps aiding wind dispersal; viable seed set is reported as infrequent in many horticultural contexts [3].  
- Phenology: Flowering and fruiting vary by locality and habitat; vegetative propagation predominates in cultivated stands due to irregular seed production [3][4].

Diagnostic notes  
- B. caapi can be differentiated from some congeners and allied genera by its combination of opposite leaves, cymose inflorescences, and distinctive stem anatomy; however, field identification is often guided by local ethnobotanical knowledge of morphotypes used for specific ritual and medicinal purposes [1][4][8].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Native range  
- Banisteriopsis caapi is native to the lowland rainforests of western to central Amazonia, with records from Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and adjacent regions [1][4][5]. Occurrence data aggregated by biodiversity infrastructures (e.g., GBIF) corroborate a distribution centered in humid tropical forests of the Amazon Basin [5].

Habitat and ecology  
- The species thrives in primary and secondary rainforest, establishing in semi-shaded understory conditions and climbing into higher strata as it matures. It is typically associated with humid, well-drained tropical environments, benefiting from high rainfall and warm temperatures characteristic of Amazonian lowlands [1][3][5].  
- In managed landscapes near Indigenous and mestizo communities, B. caapi is frequently maintained in homegardens, forest-fallow mosaics, and along forest margins, reflecting its integration into ethnomedical and ceremonial lifeways [1][2].

Cultivation outside the native range  
- B. caapi is cultivated beyond Amazonia in suitable tropical and subtropical locales and occasionally under greenhouse conditions. Horticultural and herbarium resources document cultivation in places such as Hawaiʻi [6] and experimental/collection settings in the United States [9]. Vegetative propagation by cuttings is the standard approach because seed set can be irregular and seed viability low [3][4].  
- While broadly amenable to tropical cultivation, sustained growth depends on warmth, humidity, and structural support for climbing; cold and drought sensitivity constrain open-field cultivation in temperate climates [3][6].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Cultural centrality  
- Banisteriopsis caapi holds profound esoteric, social, and medicinal stature among numerous Amazonian Indigenous peoples—including Shipibo, Kaxinawá (Huni Kuin), Tukano, and Cofán—and among mestizo practitioners of vegetalismo [1][2]. It is considered a plant teacher and an axis of knowledge transmission, healing practice, and community cohesion [1][2][7][8].

Ayahuasca brew and companion plants  
- As the pharmacological backbone of [[ayahuasca]], B. caapi is decocted with DMT-containing plants, most commonly [[Psychotria viridis]] (“chacruna”), among other regional admixtures [1][2]. The β-carbolines in B. caapi enable the oral activity of DMT by inhibiting monoamine oxidase-A, conferring the visionary and introspective effects for which the brew is known [1][4].  
- Preparations vary widely by region, lineage, and occasion. Some traditions use “pure vine” (caapi-only) decoctions for cleansing, divination, or apprentice training, while others emphasize particular vine morphotypes or specific admixture ratios for healing, diagnosis, initiation, and divinatory work [1][2][4].

Ritual frameworks and healing logics  
- Ceremonies are led by specialized healers (curanderos, onanyabo, yagéceros) who steward the setting through songs (icaros), prayer, perfume, and the orchestration of dietetic and behavioral protocols intended to open channels of learning and healing [1][2][7].  
- Reported outcomes include diagnosis and treatment of illness, resolution of interpersonal or communal tensions, recovery of vitality or “soul parts,” and instruction from plant spirits—a relational epistemology in which the vine is an agentive teacher [1][2][7][8]. Purgation (emesis and catharsis) is framed as integral to cleansing and rebalancing [2][7].  
- Indigenous specialists recognize multiple vine “types” or morphotypes—e.g., tucunacá, amarelinho, ourinho, and caupuri—distinguished by stem architecture, bark texture, coloring, and reputed strength, with corresponding ceremonial and therapeutic indications [4]. Such emic classifications often align with variations in alkaloid profiles and perceived phenomenology [4].

Global diffusion and syncretism  
- Since the late 20th century, practices centered on B. caapi have expanded globally through pilgrimage, research, and the growth of syncretic religious movements such as União do Vegetal and Santo Daime, which ritualize the sacrament (hoasca/daime) in liturgical settings [1]. In parallel, non-Indigenous therapeutic, spiritual, and wellness milieus now engage with ayahuasca practices outside the Amazon, raising complex questions about authenticity, safety, equity, and the ethics of cultural translation [1][7][8].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Principal constituents  
- β-carbolines: Harmine (ca. 0.31–8.43%), tetrahydroharmine (THH; 0.05–2.94%), and harmaline (0.03–0.83%) are the principal alkaloids, concentrated in the stem and present to varying degrees in other tissues [1][2][4]. Chemotypic diversity is considerable across morphotypes and cultivation sources, with documented intra- and inter-plant variability [4].  
- Polyphenols and related compounds: Proanthocyanidins, epicatechin, and procyanidin B2 have been detected as minor constituents, contributing to antioxidant capacity in vitro and potentially modulating the overall pharmacological profile [1][4].

Mechanisms of action  
- Reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase-A (RIMA): Harmine and harmaline act as selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitors, slowing the catabolism of monoamines and thereby permitting orally ingested DMT to reach the central nervous system when co-administered with DMT-containing plants (e.g., [[Psychotria viridis]]) [1][4].  
- Intrinsic psychoactivity: Beyond enabling DMT, β-carbolines exhibit mild psychoactivity, with reported effects on vigilance, mood, and sensory processing. Experimental literature further explores potential neuroprotective and antioxidant properties, though mechanisms and clinical relevance remain active areas of research [4].  
- Pharmacokinetic considerations: Variability in alkaloid ratios—particularly the balance of harmine/harmaline to THH—may influence experiential quality (e.g., stimulation vs. sedation) and duration, underlining the importance of chemotype and preparation practices in ceremonial contexts [1][4].

Safety, interactions, and contraindications  
- As MAO-A inhibitors, harmala alkaloids can interact with serotonergic agents and certain psychoactives; harmala RIMAs entail fewer dietary restrictions than nonselective or irreversible MAOIs, yet caution and medical screening are widely emphasized across clinical and traditional settings [1]. Adverse events are more likely when ayahuasca is combined with contraindicated medications or used without appropriate guidance and screening [1][2].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Harvesting and selection  
- Mature vines—often preferred at five years of age or older—are selected following ecological and cultural protocols, including prayers, offerings, or other respectful engagements with plant guardians [2][4]. The choice of morphotype may be matched to the healing objective, with specialists selecting specific vine types reputed for “strength” or particular teachings [4].  
- Sections of vine are cut, debarked or shaved, and then pounded or split to increase surface area and facilitate extraction [1][2]. Leaves of admixture plants are harvested fresh on the day of preparation in many lineages [1][2].

Decoction practices  
- The canonical preparation is a slow, extended boil of vine and admixture materials—most commonly B. caapi with leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]]—in water, sometimes in sequential decoctions that are combined and reduced to a thick, bitter liquid [1][2][4]. Ratios of vine to leaves, number of decoction rounds, and reduction endpoints vary by lineage and intent; specialist knowledge dictates adjustments for group size, context (healing vs. initiation), and anticipated strength [1][2].  
- Caapi-only decoctions (without DMT admixtures) are also employed for cleansing, dieta apprenticeships, divination, and specific medical indications, emphasizing the vine’s intrinsic effects and teachings [1][2][7].

Ceremonial roles and conduct  
- Ceremonies are typically conducted at night under the guidance of experienced practitioners. Preparations include dietary restrictions, abstentions, and ritual etiquette (e.g., seating arrangements, the use of protective songs and perfumery) believed to shape the phenomenology and safety of the work [1][2][7].  
- Songs (icaros) are central technologies of healing, navigation, and protection. Practitioners describe songs as channels through which plant spirits are invoked and through which visions and bodily processes are modulated [1][7]. Purgation—through emesis, sweating, and defecation—is culturally interpreted as a therapeutic and diagnostic process, not merely a side effect [2][7].  
- Beyond individual healing, ceremonies function as communal institutions that renew social bonds, resolve conflicts, and mediate relations with nonhuman beings and places, embedding the vine within broader cosmologies of reciprocity and care [1][7][8].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Supply, demand, and sustainability  
- The internationalization of ayahuasca has increased demand for B. caapi, with reports of localized overharvesting in some source regions [4]. In many communities, however, routine ceremonial demand is met by cultivated vines, as B. caapi is well suited to vegetative propagation and can be maintained in homegardens and agroforestry plots [2][3].  
- Cultivation by cuttings ensures reliable supply but may narrow the genetic base of widely circulated material. Conservation strategies that include seed regeneration, living collections, and documentation of morphotype diversity can help safeguard intraspecific variation and associated cultural knowledge [3][4].

Propagation, horticulture, and ex situ stewardship  
- Standard practice favors cuttings taken from healthy, mature vines, rooted in humid, warm conditions with structural support for climbing. Given the species’ sensitivity to cold and drought, successful ex situ cultivation often requires tropical or greenhouse environments [3][6][9].  
- Botanical gardens and ethnobotanical collections that steward B. caapi should adopt transparent provenance records, avoid wild collection when cultivated sources suffice, and collaborate with source communities to ensure benefit sharing and respectful representation [3][4][7].

Cultural rights and equitable engagement  
- Indigenous intellectual and cultural rights over ayahuasca-related knowledge and germplasm are central ethical concerns. Scholars and practitioners emphasize the need to resist biopiracy and misappropriation and to uphold community protocols in research, trade, and ceremony [1][4][7][8].  
- Legal frameworks vary internationally. Some jurisdictions recognize religious exemptions for sacramental use (e.g., certain activities of União do Vegetal and Santo Daime), while others regulate or prohibit import, preparation, or ceremony. Prospective participants and facilitators must understand local laws and prioritize safety and cultural accountability [1].  
- Ethical collaboration entails free, prior, and informed consent; fair compensation; co-authorship or acknowledgment where appropriate; and support for Indigenous-led stewardship, education, and conservation initiatives that sustain both biological and cultural diversity [1][4][7][8].
