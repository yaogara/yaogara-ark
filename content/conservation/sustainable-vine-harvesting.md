## Abstract
Banisteriopsis caapi (ayahuasca vine) and Psychotria viridis (chacruna) are fundamental to Amazonian healing lineages as primary ingredients in ayahuasca, a teacher plant brew central to rituals among Indigenous, mestizo, and regional societies (Plowman 1979; Schultes 1978; [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21295130/]). Their rising global popularity presents an urgent need for guidelines addressing sustainable vine harvesting and reforestation strategies to ensure the longevity of both plant populations and cultural practices. This research draft synthesizes ethnobotanical and anthropological data, emphasizing ecological, cultural, and ethical dimensions for the Yaogará Research Archive.

## Botanical Classification
Two taxa predominate in the canonical ayahuasca decoction, each with multiple local names and morphotypes:

- Banisteriopsis caapi
  - Kingdom: Plantae
  - Family: Malpighiaceae
  - Genus: Banisteriopsis
  - Species: Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C.V.Morton
  - Common names: ayahuasca, yagé, caapi
  - Notes: A perennial woody liana; numerous vernacular morphotypes are recognized by Amazonian specialists (McKenna 1984; Schultes & Hofmann 1992).

- Psychotria viridis
  - Kingdom: Plantae
  - Family: Rubiaceae
  - Genus: Psychotria
  - Species: Psychotria viridis Ruiz & Pav.
  - Common names: chacruna, chacrona
  - Notes: A shrub with regionally variable phenotypes; substitutions with other DMT-containing taxa are documented (Schultes et al. 2001; McKenna 1984; Schultes & Hofmann 1992; [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0306312720920362]).

Ayahuasca typically consists of these two plants: [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] (Malpighiaceae), a woody liana native to the western and central Amazon, and [[Psychotria viridis]] (Rubiaceae), a shrub widely distributed in the same region (Schultes et al. 2001; [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0306312720920362]). Numerous morphotypes of B. caapi and regional variations of P. viridis exist, sometimes substituted with other species (McKenna 1984; Schultes & Hofmann 1992).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
- Banisteriopsis caapi is native to the western and central Amazon basin, occurring across present-day Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and Bolivia. The liana grows as a canopy climber in humid, mature rainforest, where it twines up host trees. It is also frequently cultivated in chacras (gardens) and thrives in disturbed or secondary forests where light conditions favor rapid growth and regeneration.

- Psychotria viridis is broadly distributed in the Amazon and adjacent tropical regions, both in wild populations and garden cultivation. As a shade-tolerant understory shrub, it grows well under partial canopy and along forest edges. Traditional agroforestry systems integrate P. viridis with staple crops and fruit trees, promoting microhabitats that support perennial leaf production.

Across the region, local ecotypes and cultivation lineages reflect long-term management by Indigenous and mestizo communities, who select for vigor, desirable alkaloid profiles, and resilience to local soils and rainfall patterns (Schultes & Hofmann 1992; McKenna 1984).

## Ethnobotanical Context
Indigenous peoples—such as the Shipibo-Konibo, Kichwa, Shuar, and others—as well as Amazonian mestizo healers and expanding urban communities, employ ayahuasca for diagnosis, healing, social integration, and spiritual knowledge (plantas con madre) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21295130/]; Schultes 1986). Preparation and handling of vines are traditionally embedded in complex ritual protocols, including gender-specific harvesting practices, periods of celibacy, and prayers for reciprocity with plant spirits (Luna 1986; Labate & Cavnar 2014).

Within these systems, [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] is often regarded as the principal “teacher,” the axis of the brew’s pedagogy and moral instruction, with [[Psychotria viridis]] providing visions that amplify diagnostic and cosmological insights. The work of healers (maestros/maestras, onayas, yachaks) is embedded in apprenticeship pathways known as dietas—structured periods of seclusion, fasting, and ingestion of particular “teacher plants”—through which initiates establish enduring relations with plant beings and acquire specialized skills ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21295130/]).

The expansion of ayahuasca practice into urban Amazonian centers and beyond has generated new institutional forms—churches, intercultural centers, and community gardens—while also catalyzing debates around cultural continuity, intellectual property, and ecological stewardship (Labate & Cavnar 2014). Despite these changes, many lineages emphasize that sustainable harvesting is inseparable from ritual obligations, ethical comportment, and reciprocal care for the forest.

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
The primary psychoactive constituents of ayahuasca derive from the complementary chemistry of its two main components:

- Banisteriopsis caapi: rich in β-carboline alkaloids—harmine, tetrahydroharmine (THH), and harmaline—which act as reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A). These compounds also possess intrinsic psychoactivity, tremorogenic and sedative properties, and may influence neuroplasticity in specific contexts (McKenna 1984; Schultes & Hofmann 1992).

- Psychotria viridis: contains N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a short-acting tryptamine with poor oral bioavailability due to MAO-A metabolism. In the presence of B. caapi β-carbolines, orally ingested DMT becomes psychoactive, producing characteristic alterations in perception, affect, and autobiographical processing ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21295130/]; Riba et al. 2003).

Human pharmacology studies of ayahuasca decoctions show dose-dependent subjective effects, transient cardiovascular changes, and detectable alkaloid pharmacokinetics aligned with the β-carboline–DMT synergy (Riba et al. 2003). While B. caapi is sometimes referred to as the true “teacher plant” due to its role in mediating the ayahuasca experience—even in the absence of DMT-containing admixtures (Millard 2020; [https://www.tea-assembly.com/issues/5/ayahuasca-and-the-amazon]), chacruna is valued for amplifying visions. Socially and symbolically, both plants are regarded as sentient and as holders of wisdom—mediators between healers and the spirit world. The act of respectful harvesting reinforces interdependence between humans, plants, and forest ecologies (Luna 1986; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971).

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Preparation of ayahuasca commonly involves co-decocting shredded sections of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] vine with fresh or dried leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]]. Healers adjust plant ratios, cooking duration, and number of reductions according to lineage norms and situational aims (diagnosis, teaching, initiation). Ritual specialists observe dietary restrictions and maintain prayerful intent throughout collection and preparation, reinforcing norms of reciprocity with plant guardians and forest beings (Luna 1986; Labate & Cavnar 2014).

Harvesting practices reflect ecological knowledge accumulated over generations:

- Harvesting Banisteriopsis caapi lianas is labor-intensive, requiring careful extraction to preserve the root system and facilitate regrowth. Traditional protocols emphasize:
  - Selection of mature, thick vines (at least 5–10 years old) to prevent overharvesting of younger, non-reproductive individuals (Plowman 1979; Kuyper 2020).
  - Cutting the main stem above several nodes, leaving part of the vine attached to the host tree to allow vegetative regrowth.
  - Prohibiting clear-cutting; harvesters ensure a mosaic approach, rotating among different sites and leaving sufficient individuals for continued ecological function and ceremonial use.
  - Incorporating prayers and rituals seeking permission from plant spirits and forest guardians—integral to Indigenous agroforestry systems ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21295130/]).

- Harvesting Psychotria viridis (chacruna) leaves typically relies on selective pruning that preserves the shrub’s architecture and photosynthetic capacity. Care is taken to:
  - Harvest from multiple shrubs to avoid repeated defoliation of the same individuals.
  - Maintain mother plants for both seed production and vegetative propagation through cuttings.
  - Avoid stripping wild populations, emphasizing garden cultivation and community-managed stocks where demand is high.

These protocols function as ecological safeguards and ritual obligations. In many lineages, apprentices learn to identify morphotypes, recognize maturity and vigor, and assess the surrounding forest’s health before any harvest—an integrated stewardship practice linking plant vitality to ceremonial efficacy (Luna 1986; Labate & Cavnar 2014).

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
The growing international demand for [[Ayahuasca]]—along with regional pressures from urbanization—threatens wild populations and the knowledge systems they support (Tym 2022; Kuyper 2020). Effective sustainability strategies include:

- Harvesting Guidelines
  - Only harvest mature B. caapi vines, leaving portions attached to the host tree and avoiding removal of the root system.
  - Use rotational harvest schedules and map harvest sites to ensure long-term population viability.
  - For chacruna, employ pruning instead of clear-cutting whole bushes, maintaining adequate mother plants for seed production and vegetative propagation.

- Reforestation Strategies
  - Establish community-based vine nurseries and agroforestry plots, cultivating both plants alongside traditional forest crops (Kuyper 2020; Labate & Cavnar 2014).
  - Prioritize the use of seed and vegetative material sourced from local genetic stocks to preserve ecotypic diversity.
  - Systematically document phenotypic and chemotypic variation for future stewardship.

- Ethical and Biocultural Considerations
  - Recognize and respect Indigenous land rights, knowledge holders, and management protocols (Labate & Cavnar 2014).
  - Support benefit-sharing partnerships and community initiatives that integrate traditional governance with modern conservation science.
  - Advocate for participatory certification schemes for sustainable ayahuasca products, with traceability to community-managed cultivation sites (Tym 2022).

Traditional ecological knowledge systems—encompassing ritual, ecological, and social dimensions—should be central in all sustainability strategies, ensuring preservation of both biodiversity and cultural integrity ([https://mckenna.academy/course/an-introduction-to-ethnobotany/]).

Implementing these measures requires coordinated action across supply chains and territories. For example, nurseries can propagate diverse B. caapi morphotypes from cuttings while simultaneously establishing seed gardens to maintain genetic diversity. Mixed agroforestry plantings situate ayahuasca species among food trees and timber species, distributing harvest pressure and creating resilient mosaics across landscapes. Community-led mapping of harvest zones, combined with agreed-upon rest intervals, helps prevent serial overharvesting. Documentation of lineage-specific pruning and cooking protocols can be paired with chemotypic assays to build living collections that safeguard both cultural and phytochemical diversity (Kuyper 2020; Labate & Cavnar 2014).

Certification initiatives—if pursued—must be participatory, culturally grounded, and oriented toward local priorities. Such schemes can emphasize criteria like provenance, cultivation method, rotational harvest adherence, fair compensation, and reinvestment in community ecological projects. Equally important are mechanisms that secure Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for any biocultural knowledge sharing, and that ensure benefit-sharing aligns with local governance and customary law (Labate & Cavnar 2014).

Finally, education remains a key axis of sustainability. Intercultural training for harvesters, facilitators, and researchers can disseminate best practices while reinforcing the primacy of Indigenous leadership. Community gardens and seed banks provide focal points for youth engagement and biocultural revitalization, while translocal networks help circulate planting material and stewardship knowledge adapted to diverse microclimates. Such efforts can temper extraction pressures by scaling up cultivation and restoring the relational ethics that anchor ayahuasca lineages.
