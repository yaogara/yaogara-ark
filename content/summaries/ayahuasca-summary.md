## Abstract

**Ayahuasca** is a psychoactive decoction originating in the Upper Amazon Basin, prepared by combining the vine *Banisteriopsis caapi* (Malpighiaceae) with the leaves of *Psychotria viridis* (Rubiaceae) or other DMT-containing plants such as *Diplopterys cabrerana*. The interaction of β-carboline alkaloids from *B. caapi* with N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) from the admixture enables oral psychoactivity by inhibiting monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A).  

For centuries, Indigenous peoples such as the Shipibo-Conibo, Tukano, and Cofán have used the brew for healing, divination, and spiritual initiation. Since the twentieth century, its use has expanded globally through syncretic religious movements and therapeutic research, prompting new scientific, legal, and ethical attention.

## Composition and Pharmacology

### Primary Botanical Sources

- **Banisteriopsis caapi** — a woody liana native to the Amazon Basin, rich in β-carboline alkaloids (*harmine*, *harmaline*, *tetrahydroharmine*). These act as reversible MAO-A inhibitors, preventing enzymatic breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters and orally ingested DMT.  
- **Psychotria viridis** — a perennial shrub containing N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a tryptamine derivative and serotonin-receptor agonist primarily acting at 5-HT₂A receptors.

Alternative DMT-bearing species such as *Diplopterys cabrerana* and *Mimosa tenuiflora* are sometimes used regionally. The proportion of vine to leaf material, brewing duration, and plant variety strongly influence alkaloid content and psychoactive profile.

### Chemical Synergy

Ayahuasca’s pharmacological effect results from the **synergistic inhibition of MAO-A** by β-carbolines and the subsequent absorption of DMT. Harmine and harmaline produce mild psychoactivity themselves and extend DMT’s activity to several hours.  

Beyond MAO inhibition, β-carbolines exhibit additional actions—serotonin reuptake inhibition, antioxidant activity, and possible neurogenesis promotion—suggesting a multi-mechanistic therapeutic potential.

## Traditional and Cultural Context

### Indigenous Use

Archaeological and ethnographic evidence suggests ayahuasca use for at least a millennium across the Amazon Basin. It remains central among the **Shipibo-Conibo**, **Tukano**, **Shuar**, **Cofán**, **Kamsá**, and other nations. Ceremonies serve for physical and spiritual healing, divination, initiation rites, and community cohesion.

### Ritual and Healing Practice

Ceremonies are typically led by shamans or **curanderos**, who sing healing songs known as **icaros** to guide visions and modulate energetic processes. Participants follow preparatory diets (*dietas*) restricting salt, alcohol, and sexual activity to enhance sensitivity and safety.  

Ayahuasca visions are interpreted as communications with plant or ancestral spirits that reveal illness causes, transmit knowledge, or restore balance between the physical and spiritual worlds.

### Syncretic Religions

In the twentieth century, ayahuasca became formalized within Brazilian **syncretic religions** such as **Santo Daime**, **Barquinha**, and **União do Vegetal (UDV)**. These movements blend Christian symbolism, Spiritism, and Indigenous cosmologies. Their ceremonies are conducted in structured formats—hymn singing, meditation, and communal prayer—and are recognized as legitimate religious sacraments in Brazil.

Today, ayahuasca churches operate across Europe and North America, contributing to global awareness but also raising questions of cultural appropriation and regulation.

## Preparation and Use

Traditional preparation involves pounding sections of *B. caapi* vine and slow-boiling them with *P. viridis* leaves over many hours. The concentrated brew is consumed in small portions within a ceremonial context, often at night in a **maloca** (ceremonial house).  

The onset of effects occurs within 30–60 minutes, peaks at 1–2 hours, and lasts 4–6 hours. Physiological effects include nausea, vomiting, and sweating—considered by practitioners a **purification** rather than side effects. Psychological effects range from vivid visual imagery to emotional catharsis and perceived communication with spiritual entities.

## Therapeutic and Neuroscientific Research

Modern research explores ayahuasca’s potential in treating depression, anxiety, trauma, and substance dependence. Controlled studies (e.g., Palhano-Fontes et al., 2019; Ruffell et al., 2020) report **rapid antidepressant effects** within 24–48 hours after administration, sustained for up to several weeks.  

Neuroimaging studies show modulation of brain networks such as the **default-mode network (DMN)**, associated with self-referential processing and rumination. Biochemical findings include increased serum **brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)** and markers of **neuroplasticity**.  

Proposed mechanisms involve MAO-A inhibition, serotonin 5-HT₂A receptor agonism, sigma-1 receptor modulation, and psychotherapeutic processing under altered states of consciousness.

## Legal and Ethical Dimensions

### Legal Status

Because **DMT** is listed as a Schedule I substance under the **1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances**, ayahuasca exists in a gray legal area. The convention does not control plants containing DMT, allowing national discretion.  

- **Legal or Tolerated:** Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia.  
- **Permitted via Religious Exemption:** United States (UDV, Santo Daime), Canada.  
- **Prohibited:** France, United Kingdom, Australia, most EU states.  

Ongoing court cases in France and North America highlight the tension between freedom of religion, indigenous rights, and narcotics control frameworks.

### Cultural and Intellectual Property Issues

The globalization of ayahuasca has prompted debates on **biopiracy** and **intellectual property rights**. In 1986, a U.S. patent was controversially granted for a cultivated *B. caapi* variety (“Da Vine”), sparking international protest and eventual revocation.  

Ethical practice emphasizes **free, prior, and informed consent** from source communities, equitable benefit-sharing, and acknowledgment of Indigenous custodianship. Many organizations now advocate **sustainable cultivation** and **reciprocity initiatives** supporting forest conservation and cultural preservation.

## Conservation and Sustainability

Rising demand for ayahuasca has increased pressure on wild *B. caapi* and *P. viridis* populations, especially around tourism hubs in Peru and Brazil. The vine requires 3–10 years to mature; unsustainable harvesting can devastate local ecosystems.  

Community-based **agroforestry cultivation** programs integrate the vine and leaf plants with native tree species, promoting ecological balance and economic resilience. Studies show that regions under **Indigenous land tenure** maintain significantly lower deforestation rates, underscoring the role of cultural guardianship in conservation.
