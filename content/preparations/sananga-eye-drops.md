## Abstract
Sananga is a term for Amazonian eye drops prepared primarily from the roots and bark of Tabernaemontana species, most commonly Tabernaemontana undulata (Apocynaceae). It is applied directly to the eyes in ceremonial and medicinal contexts by Indigenous groups including the Yawanawá, Kaxinawá (Huni Kuin), and Matsés, where it is credited with sharpening physical vision, aiding hunting, cleansing ritual “energy,” and removing panema—forms of malaise and blockage recognized in regional cosmologies [1][2][3][5]. In contemporary practice, sananga is also used in urban and retreat settings, often in conjunction with other ceremonial modalities such as [[Ayahuasca]] and [[Kambo]] [1][5][8].

Phytochemically, Tabernaemontana species contain indole alkaloids (e.g., voacangine and related compounds), with reported antimicrobial and analgesic properties in preliminary or ethnographic accounts; however, sananga is not considered psychoactive and formal biomedical evidence for safety and efficacy in ocular application remains limited [3][6]. Ethical sourcing, community consent, and sustainable harvesting of wild plants are central considerations as global interest grows [5][8].

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae
- Order: Gentianales
- Family: Apocynaceae
- Genus: Tabernaemontana
- Principal source species: Tabernaemontana undulata (with occasional use of T. sananho) [6][3]

Tabernaemontana undulata is a shrub native to the Amazon basin, bearing white, star-shaped corollas and exuding a characteristic milky latex typical of the Apocynaceae [3][6]. Among Huni Kuin practitioners it is known as “mana heins,” while Matsés speakers refer to related eye medicines as “beçhete” [3][6]. The vernacular term “sananga” denotes the prepared ocular drops rather than the plant taxon itself and can be applied regionally to multiple plant sources used for similar purposes [3].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Tabernaemontana undulata is distributed across the Amazon basin, with occurrences documented in Brazil and Peru and broader lowland rainforest environments of northern South America [6]. These shrubs are typically understory or forest-edge plants, favoring humid, shaded to dappled light conditions and well-drained tropical soils.

- Habitat: Lowland tropical rainforest ecosystems, including riverine and terra firme forests [6].
- Growth form: Evergreen shrub or small tree; foliage is opposite and leathery, with conspicuous latex canals common to the family Apocynaceae [6].
- Reproductive features: White, star-like flowers and paired follicles containing seeds embedded in latex-rich tissue [6].

In Indigenous landscapes, Tabernaemontana taxa are integrated into local ethnofloras, where knowledge of microhabitats, phenology, and potency is transmitted through experiential learning and ritual apprenticeship [3][8]. Human-plant interactions—including selective harvesting of roots or bark—are embedded in cosmologies that emphasize reciprocity, ritual observance, and care for the forest matrix supporting the plants [1][3].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Sananga is a notable example of a topical medicine administered to highly sensitive tissue (the eyes) within structured ritual frameworks. Among Yawanawá, Kaxinawá (Huni Kuin), and Matsés communities, it is employed to enhance visual acuity, align intention and attention in ceremonial space, and dispel panema—a concept that encompasses heaviness, bad luck, hindered perception, social friction, and energetic obstruction [1][3][5].

Documented ceremonial and pragmatic uses include [1][2][3][4][5]:
- Preparation for major rituals such as [[Ayahuasca]] and [[Kambo]], supporting “inner vision,” concentration, and perceived energetic cleansing.
- Enhancement of physical sight, especially prior to hunting, where subtle motion detection, clarity in dense understory, and night vision are prized.
- Clearing of panema to restore vitality, focus, and resolve, contributing to social and spiritual well-being.
- Centering attention for meditation, prayer, and song, often as part of broader ceremonial sequences.

Application is usually guided by a knowledgeable practitioner who sets ceremonial parameters, including intentional prayer, songs, and specific gestures. Sananga’s hallmark stinging sensation—intense but ephemeral—functions within Indigenous interpretations as a purgative force that opens the eyes not only physiologically (through tearing and flushing) but spiritually, “washing” impediments to insight and perception [3][4][5]. The experience unfolds within a relational cosmology wherein plants are person-like allies or teachers, and healing results from properly aligned intention, conduct, and exchange with the plant’s spirit [3].

Beyond Indigenous communities, sananga has entered contemporary spiritual and alternative health milieus, often mediated by Indigenous or mixed-lineage facilitators. Retreat centers and workshops may incorporate sananga alongside talking circles, breathwork, meditation, and ceremonial diets. The expansion of use outside its original cultural contexts has animated debates about authenticity, fidelity to lineage protocols, consent, and benefit-sharing [5][8].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Tabernaemontana species are rich in indole alkaloids, a class widespread in Apocynaceae and structurally related to compounds found in other teacher plants. Reported constituents for T. undulata and congeners include voacangine and related iboga-type alkaloids, alongside additional indole scaffolds common to the genus [3][6]. While these molecules have drawn pharmacological interest for antimicrobial, analgesic, and neuroactive profiles at the systemic level, sananga as prepared and administered to the eyes is not regarded as psychoactive in the manner of [[Ayahuasca]] or [[Tabernanthe iboga]] [3][6].

Key considerations based on ethnographic and secondary sources [3][6]:
- Chemical profile: Indole alkaloids, with qualitative variation by species, plant part, season, and preparation method.
- Proposed activities: Antimicrobial and analgesic effects have been suggested, but evidence for ocular application remains largely anecdotal or preliminary.
- Mechanistic uncertainties: It is unclear which specific constituents, in the low concentrations delivered by aqueous eye drops, account for perceived effects on vision or “energetic” states. The intense stinging may stem from alkaloid-laden latex components and acidity; tearing and transient vasoreactivity could contribute to subjective post-application clarity [3].
- Safety and evidence gaps: Controlled clinical evaluations of ocular safety, sterility, dosing, and long-term outcomes are limited. Reported uses remain grounded primarily in Indigenous knowledge systems and recent popularization rather than formalized ophthalmic trials [3][6].

From a pharmacognostic standpoint, sananga illustrates the difficulty of mapping emic categories like “energy cleansing” onto pharmacological frameworks. While biochemical profiles of Tabernaemontana spp. are increasingly documented, the ceremony-specific variables—ritual framing, expectation, attentional training, and immediate sensory salience—likely shape outcomes. As with many topical ethnomedicines, standardization of plant identity, preparation, concentration, filtering, and storage conditions is a critical but unresolved challenge in transposing traditional practices to biomedical research designs [3][6][8].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Preparation is typically carried out by trained medicine people who combine plant selection criteria with ritual practice. Although specific techniques vary by lineage, a canonical workflow involves [1][3][5]:

- Harvest: Roots or bark are collected from wild Tabernaemontana undulata plants—sometimes from mature individuals recognized by experienced harvesters for desired potency and vitality.
- Comminution and extraction: Plant material is macerated or ground, then soaked in clean water to leach active constituents into solution. Some traditions favor cold water to avoid degrading volatile fractions; others may use lukewarm processes. Latex-bearing tissues can influence the extract’s character [3][1].
- Filtration: The infusion is carefully filtered—often multiple times—to remove particulate matter, producing a clear to brownish liquid. Cloth, fine screens, or improvised filters are used as available.
- Potency and storage: Practitioners titrate perceived strength based on lineage norms and sensory tests. Small volumes may be prepared for immediate use, with short storage periods to reduce contamination and oxidation risks.

Administration occurs in a ceremonial container that emphasizes intention, consent, and focused attention. A typical sequence includes:
- Intention setting, songs, and prayers invoking the plant’s spirit and aligning the recipient’s purpose with the medicine [3][1].
- Positioning the recipient—seated or reclined—to reduce blinking reflex and facilitate controlled application.
- Applying drops directly into each eye. Immediate, intense stinging and watering follow, usually lasting minutes. Recipients are guided to breathe steadily, keep eyes closed or half open as instructed, and remain calm as tearing and temporary blurring run their course.
- Integration: After the acute sensation subsides, participants frequently report heightened clarity, sharpened focus, lightness, or relief from “heaviness” associated with panema [4][3][5].

In broader ritual cycles, sananga may be used:
- As preparation or “opening” medicine before ceremonies with [[Ayahuasca]] or [[Kambo]] to refine attention and stabilize intention [1][2].
- As a stand-alone practice during hunting season or training periods to enhance vigilance and visual acuity [2][4].
- In combination with other non-ingested practices (chanting, tobacco smoke wafting, breath practices) as a method of realigning the individual with community, land, and task [3][4].

These procedures foreground the mutual entanglement of matter and meaning. The burning is not merely tolerated but is construed as the purifying mechanism itself; ritual songs and prayers are not symbolic add-ons but constitutive operations that activate the plant’s efficacy in Indigenous ontologies [3]. Even where sananga travels into new contexts, many facilitators retain these elements—songs, breath cues, quietude—to cultivate an ethically coherent practice and to preserve the medicine’s relational integrity [5][8].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
With rising non-Indigenous interest, conservation and ethics have become central to sananga’s future. The relevant issues span ecological, social, and epistemic domains [8][1][5]:

- Sustainable harvesting:
  - Root and bark collection can be extractive if practiced without replanting or careful pruning. Community-led protocols that limit harvest intensity, rotate collection sites, and encourage regeneration support long-term availability.
  - Maintaining forest integrity—habitat connectivity, soil health, and canopy structure—is critical for Tabernaemontana populations typical of moist lowland rainforest [6][8].
- Biocultural rights and sovereignty:
  - Knowledge of plant selection, preparation, and ritual emplacement belongs to Indigenous communities who have curated these practices over generations. Ethical sourcing recognizes this ownership and the right to define ceremonial uses and boundaries.
  - Fair trade and benefit-sharing:
    - Prioritize materials prepared or authorized by Indigenous practitioners and communities.
    - Establish transparent, equitable economic relationships, with clear pathways for community benefit rather than extractive middlemen [8][5].
- Cultural protocols and consent:
  - Respect for ceremonial norms—including who may prepare, administer, and receive sananga—helps sustain lineages and prevent misuse or dilution of meaning.
  - Teaching outside the community may occur under explicit arrangements; responsible learners uphold confidentiality, attributions, and lineage teachings as requested by elders and maestros [8].
- Quality, safety, and representation:
  - As sananga enters global markets, variability in plant identity, preparation, filtration, and storage increases. Ethical vendors disclose provenance, community partners, and preparation methods to safeguard recipients and communities alike [7][8].
  - Popular narratives often romanticize or universalize experience; accurate representation of limits and uncertainties, including the absence of robust clinical data, is essential to prevent misinformed use [3][6].

Practically, responsible engagement entails slowing commodification pressures, centering community voices, and coupling any outward-facing offerings with reciprocal commitments—cultural, ecological, and economic. For researchers, collaboration frameworks that co-design questions and share outcomes with originating communities can mitigate extractive knowledge practices and foster trust. For facilitators, adherence to lineage instructions and ongoing consent processes helps protect both participants and traditions.
