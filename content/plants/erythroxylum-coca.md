## Abstract
Erythroxylum coca (coca leaf) is a cornerstone of ancient Andean ethnobotany, renowned for its role in sustaining Indigenous endurance, facilitating ritual healing, and serving as a sacred offering in communal and religious contexts. While its alkaloids have driven global controversies surrounding coca derivatives, ethnographic and pharmacological research underscore that traditional uses are distinct, providing nutritional, medicinal, and social benefits within regulated frameworks among Andean and Amazonian cultures (Plowman 1986; [1]; [2]; [6]). This entry synthesizes botanical, ethnobotanical, chemical, and ethical dimensions of E. coca, emphasizing its significance as a teacher plant and the cultural rights linked to its stewardship.

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae  
- Order: Malpighiales  
- Family: Erythroxylaceae  
- Genus: Erythroxylum  
- Species: Erythroxylum coca Lam. (primary cultivated type: E. coca var. coca) (Plowman 1986; [1]; [3]).

- Congeners of ethnobotanical importance: E. novogranatense (often cultivated in drier habitats), with recognized varieties historically associated with coastal and inter-Andean valleys ([1]; [3]; [4]). Distinguishing cultivated complexes—E. coca (moist, mid-elevation) versus E. novogranatense (more drought-tolerant)—is central to understanding regional agroecologies and lineages ([1]; [3]; [4]).

- Morphology:
  - Growth form: Perennial, evergreen shrub typically 1–3 m in height, with flexible, smooth-barked stems.
  - Leaves: Glossy, elliptic to oblong-elliptic blades (approximately 4–8 cm), entire margins, and a conspicuous, faint pair of longitudinal lines flanking the midrib; leaves are coriaceous yet thin and pliant in cultivated types.  
  - Flowers and fruit: Small, axillary, white to pale-yellow flowers; drupaceous red fruits (1-seeded) mature through the year under cultivation.
  - Intra-specific diversity: Morphotypes cultivated by Indigenous groups (e.g., “Palo” and “Caimo” in Colombia) present variation in leaf texture, venation, and fiber composition ([2]). The Amazonian cultivated form commonly referred to as “ipadu” (E. coca var. ipadu sensu some authors) exhibits traits selected for low-stature growth and leaves suitable for toasting and powdering ([1]; [3]).

- Domestication and systematics:
  - Ethnobotanical and genomic evidence indicate multiple domestication trajectories and clonal propagation practices that maintain culturally favored chemotypes and morphotypes ([1]; [4]). Recent phylogenomic analyses refine the relationships among cultivated Erythroxylum lineages and their wild progenitors, clarifying that the “coca complex” comprises several, partially inter-fertile domesticated forms with ecological specialization ([4]).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
- Core range and centers of cultivation:
  - Andean montane slopes and adjacent foothills in present-day Peru and Bolivia constitute primary centers of historical cultivation. Coca thrives in humid, submontane to montane zones between roughly 500–2,000 meters elevation, where year-round moisture and mild temperatures support continuous leaf production (Plowman 1986; [1]; [3]).
  - In the northwest Amazon (Colombia, Brazil, Peru), coca is cultivated in lowland forest garden systems, often in semi-shaded, well-drained soils on fluvial terraces and interfluvial uplands ([1]; [3]).

- Ecological preferences:
  - E. coca var. coca prefers humid forests and cloud-forest margins with consistent rainfall and modest diurnal temperature variation.
  - E. novogranatense and its varieties are more tolerant of seasonal dryness and higher insolation, explaining historical cultivation on Peru’s northern coast and in inter-Andean valleys ([1]; [3]; [4]).

- Agroecological systems:
  - Traditional management integrates coca with multi-strata agroforestry, intercropped among fruit trees and timber species, or maintained in hedgerows near homesteads for frequent harvest. Steady pruning and selective picking prolong plant longevity and leaf productivity, while clonal propagation maintains desired traits ([1]; [3]).
  - Morphometrics and phylogenomics suggest regional “landraces” reflect cumulative farmer selection across ecozones, with gene flow shaped by trade, pilgrimage, and ritual exchange ([4]).

- Contemporary distribution:
  - Beyond Indigenous territories, coca is also present in national coca-control regimes (e.g., licit cultivation zones), gardens, and ethnobotanical collections. Ex situ representation in institutional herbaria and living collections remains limited relative to in situ diversity ([7]).

## Ethnobotanical Context
- Time depth and societal roles:
  - Archaeological, ethnohistorical, and linguistic data indicate coca’s deep integration into Andean lifeways, including its use in labor organization, ritual economies, and statecraft. The leaf functioned historically as both a quotidian aid (for endurance, digestion, and mood regulation) and a medium of sacred exchange—bridging households, kin groups, and supra-local polities (Plowman 1986; [1]; [6]).

- Daily practice:
  - Chewing coca with an alkaline adjunct (lime or plant ash) supports prolonged physical labor, mitigates sensations of hunger and thirst, and alleviates altitude-related discomfort. Among highland Quechua- and Aymara-speaking communities, acullico (quencha: pijchar) is synchronized with work rhythms and communal rest, interwoven with oral histories and social etiquette around the offering and circulation of leaves ([5]; [6]).

- Ritual and meaning:
  - Coca leaf is a privileged offering in [[pago a la tierra]] ceremonies and reciprocal “payments” to mountain deities and ancestral beings. Leaf arrangement, choice of morphotype, and the act of blowing and placing leaves encode intention, cure, and covenant. Specialists—ritualists, midwives, and healers—deploy coca for divination, diagnosis, and the restoration of social equilibrium ([1]; [5]).
  - In the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Kogi, Arhuaco, Wiwa, Kankuamo), coca is embedded in moral-ecological frameworks that bind people to territory. The poporo—a gourd holding lime used to activate alkaloids—materializes personal and communal obligations; mastery of coca practice is inseparable from apprenticeship in law, memory, and landscape ([5]).

- Amazonian modalities:
  - In the northwest Amazon, coca is toasted, mixed with alkaline plant ashes, and powdered into a green preparation often termed “mambe.” Consumed in nocturnal dialogues and council houses, mambe is paired with speech, law, and kinship remembrance. While local formulations vary, a shared emphasis is placed on balanced stimulation conducive to sustained, attentive conversation, not intoxication ([1]).

- Contemporary politics and recognition:
  - Despite global stigma tied to cocaine, many Indigenous jurisdictions protect ancestral coca cultivation and use, and communities assert the clear distinction between whole-leaf practices and illicit refinement. Nonetheless, enforcement actions and illicit markets disrupt traditional economies and threaten custodial knowledge ([5]; [6]). Advocacy continues for policy frameworks that safeguard Indigenous autonomy, ceremonial spaces, and local markets of whole-leaf products (e.g., teas), while suppressing harmful trafficking ([5]).

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
- Principal constituents:
  - Coca leaves contain a complex alkaloid suite, dominated by cocaine typically in the range of 0.25–0.77% dry weight, accompanied by minor alkaloids such as benzoylecgonine and cinnamoylcocaine ([2]; [6]). Profiles vary by species/variety, ecological conditions, and harvest regime.
  - Nutritional analyses indicate high dietary fiber fractions (>50% of leaf dry weight), along with simple sugars (sucrose, glucose, fructose), volatile fatty acids (notably hexadecanoic and octadecanoic acids), and polyphenols with antioxidant activity ([2]). These components contribute to the leaf’s astringent mouthfeel and sustained-release characteristics during mastication.

- Mechanisms of action in traditional use:
  - In acullico and mambe practices, alkalinized saliva liberates free-base alkaloids that are absorbed primarily through the oral mucosa. The gradual, buccal route—together with fiber-rich matrices and co-occurring phytochemicals—yields a slow-onset, mild stimulant effect that reduces fatigue and blunts hunger without the rapid euphoria or toxicity associated with purified cocaine salts or base ([6]).
  - Field observation aligns with pharmacokinetic expectations: users report steady vigilance and mood stabilization compatible with sustained physical or cognitive tasks; community norms emphasize dosing that maintains equilibrium rather than intoxication ([6]).

- Bioactivity and safety considerations:
  - In vitro assessments report antioxidant and cytotoxic activities in leaf extracts, motivating interest in nutraceutical applications; toxic actions emerge primarily at concentrations exceeding those achieved in customary use ([2]). Longstanding cultural protocols—timed chewing, moderated admixture of lime/ashes, and fasting/meal coordination—function as embodied safety guidelines ([5]; [6]).
  - Interactions with alkaline adjuncts: Calcium-rich lime (calcined shells, limestone) and plant ash increase pH and modulate absorption, shaping both intensity and duration of perceived effects. Traditional mixtures are calibrated to local chemotypes and individual tolerances, minimizing unwanted psychoactivity ([5]; [6]).

## Traditional Preparation and Use
- Cultivation and harvest:
  - Propagation is typically via stem cuttings to preserve desired chemotypes, though seed is used in some contexts. Plants are pruned to facilitate hand-harvest and branching. Harvest proceeds year-round, with selective picking of mature, turgid leaves to maintain vigor and yield; leaves are immediately bundled or lightly wilted in shade to prevent bruising (Plowman 1986; [1]; [5]).

- Chewing (acullico, pijchar):
  - Users place a quid of leaves in the cheek with small pinches of lime or alkaline ash, renewing leaves slowly over one to two hours. Alkaloids are absorbed buccally; fiber is expectorated at the end of a session. Social protocols govern gifting, reciprocity, and the order of chewing during collective work, travel, or ritual pauses ([5]; [6]).

- Amazonian powder (mambe):
  - Leaves are toasted gently, powdered, and homogenized with sifted plant ashes to produce a silky, bright-green preparation consumed in measured pinches. Nocturnal conversations and dispute resolution settings emphasize a calm, clear attentiveness rather than stimulation per se; mambe is shared as discursive “food,” linked to ethical speech and memory ([1]).

- Infusions and domestic remedies:
  - Coca tea (mate de coca) is a widely used digestive and mild stimulant infusion, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. Preparations are light and non-intoxicating, commonly employed for altitude-associated discomfort, stomach upset, and early-morning fatigue ([6]). Decoctions or macerations may be used topically in some locales.

- Ceremonial offerings and divination:
  - Leaves are bundled, blown upon, and arranged as offerings in [[pago a la tierra]] and related rites; seers interpret leaf orientation, color, and minor imperfections as diagnostic signs. In Colombia’s Sierra Nevada, the poporo mediates continuous, life-long engagement with coca and lime, refining bodily technique and ethical sensibility ([5]). These practices situate coca within broader networks of teacher plants, occasionally paired or sequenced with others such as [[Nicotiana rustica]] in certain regions, always under local norms of balance and respect ([1]; [5]).

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
- Agroecological sustainability:
  - Traditional coca agroforestry—featuring polyculture, shade, and rotational harvesting—maintains soil structure, biodiversity, and genetic diversity in farmer-managed stands. Clonal continuity ensures trait stability, while occasional introductions diversify local stocks ([1]; [3]). Threats include habitat conversion, forced eradication, and simplified monocultures associated with illicit economies.

- Genetic resources and research:
  - Conservation of intraspecific diversity is urgent, particularly for under-documented Amazonian morphotypes and regionally adapted landraces. Morphometric and phylogenomic work has begun to clarify lineages and domestication pathways, but living collections and community-led seedbanks remain under-resourced ([4]; [7]). Ethical research partnerships should prioritize community consent, equitable benefit sharing, and co-authorship of findings.

- Cultural rights and policy:
  - The distinction between whole-leaf coca and illicit derivatives is foundational to Indigenous rights claims and to public health discourse. Communities emphasize that regulated, traditional use has documented social and nutritional benefits and is embedded in ceremonial law—distinct from cocaine manufacture and trafficking ([5]; [6]). Policy approaches that criminalize traditional practices undermine cultural survival and can exacerbate environmental harm through indiscriminate eradication. Conversely, frameworks that recognize ancestral stewardship can strengthen conservation outcomes and economic alternatives ([5]).

- Ethical sourcing and use:
  - For researchers and visitors, respectful engagement entails:
    - Seeking free, prior, and informed consent from local authorities for any documentation or collection.
    - Avoiding contributions to illicit markets; sourcing only through community-approved channels.
    - Honoring ceremonial restrictions and not publicizing sensitive ritual knowledge without permission.
    - Supporting community-led monitoring of plant health, soil fertility, and landscape integrity.
