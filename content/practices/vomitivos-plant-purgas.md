## Abstract
Vomitivos and plant purgas—water or plant-based emetic rituals—hold a significant place in Amazonian ethnomedicine, serving as foundational methods for energetic and physical cleansing among numerous Indigenous and regional groups. Distinct from psychoactive plant ceremonies, emetic purges are widely practiced to expel impurities, alleviate illness, and prepare participants for deeper healing or visionary work. These traditions, which include both simple water vomiting rituals and the ingestion of emetogenic plants, reflect a sophisticated understanding of health, personhood, and community well-being. This research draft documents the cultural, medicinal, and ritual significance of Amazonian vomitivos and plant purges, focusing on their ethnobotanical diversity, preparation, ceremonial role, and transmission among Indigenous and mestizo healing lineages across Western Amazonia[(Schultes 1994)[2];(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3]].

## Botanical Classification
Because “vomitivos” and “purgas” denote ritual practices rather than a single taxon, botanical classification centers on the principal plant lineages and representative species employed as emetics or adjuncts:

- Practice category
  - Emetic rituals: vomitivos (water-based or salted water emesis) and plant purgas (decoctions or macerations of emetogenic taxa).
- Major plant families represented
  - Rubiaceae: Carapichea (syn. Cephaelis), Psychotria (sensu lato).
  - Apocynaceae: Tabernaemontana spp. and allied indole alkaloid–producing shrubs.
  - Aquifoliaceae and Sapindaceae (adjuncts): Ilex (e.g., guayusa) and Paullinia (e.g., yoco) as stimulant brews sometimes associated with early-morning purification.
- Representative taxa cited in Amazonian practice
  - Carapichea ipecacuanha (syn. Cephaelis ipecacuanha; historically also placed within Psychotria) — “ipecac,” a canonical emetic source in South American materia medica[(Schultes 1994)[2]].
  - Psychotria spp. — diverse understory shrubs; some lineages are used as emetogenic purgatives distinct from visionary [[Psychotria viridis]].
  - Tabernaemontana spp. — latex-bearing shrubs with bioactive indole alkaloids; local species may be prepared as strong purgatives in specific lineages.
  - Ilex guayusa and Paullinia yoco — caffeine-rich morning beverages that, in some communities, accompany dawn cleansing and may be followed by or culminate in emesis[(Schultes 1994)[2]].
- Contextual teacher plants (for comparative ritual frame)
  - Ayahuasca assemblages: [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] (with [[Psychotria viridis]] or other admixtures) are not primarily “vomitivos,” yet their use often involves purging as part of a broader therapeutic arc[(Ayahuasca – Wikipedia)[1];(Schultes 1994)[2]].
  - Tobacco rites: Strong tobacco such as [[Nicotiana rustica]] may induce nausea and vomiting and is used in purification and fortification contexts in several traditions.

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
The practice of plant-induced emesis is geographically widespread throughout the Amazon Basin, notably among the Huni Kuĩ, Shuar, Yanomami, Kichwa, and Shipibo, as well as mestizo and caboclo communities in Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, and Colombia[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3];(Yanomami: A Forest People 2022)[5]]. Regional variants are shaped by ecological availability, historical exchange, and lineage-specific pedagogy:

- Western Amazonia (Peru, Ecuador, Colombia): Dawn purges accompany apprenticeships in vegetalismo and community rites among Kichwa and Shuar/Achuar, with water vomitivos and plant decoctions prescribed for cleansing and preparation for ceremonies such as ayahuasca[(Schultes 1994)[2];(Ayahuasca – Wikipedia)[1]].
- Southwestern Amazonia (Acre, Brazil): Among Huni Kuĩ lineages, purgas are central to removing panema (a broad domain of malaise, misfortune, and energetic heaviness), restoring vitality and relational balance[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3]].
- Northern Amazonia (Roraima, Brazil; Venezuela): Yanomami communities integrate early-morning collective purging as protection and renewal within broader cosmological frameworks[(Yanomami: A Forest People 2022)[5]].

The plant taxa used for purging generally inhabit lowland rainforest ecotones:

- Rubiaceae emetics such as Carapichea/“ipecac” typically occur in humid, shaded understory niches with well-drained but moist soils.
- Psychotria spp. are characteristic of terra firme and secondary forests, often thriving along path edges and canopy gaps.
- Tabernaemontana spp. favor well-drained sites in tropical lowland forests and may be found along rivers or in forest margins.
- Ilex guayusa and Paullinia yoco are cultivated or semi-wild in Andean-Amazonian foothills and lowlands, woven into dawn beverage customs that can include or precede emesis[(Schultes 1994)[2]].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Among Indigenous Amazonian groups, the concept of “purga” (purge) and “vomitivo” is integral to cleansing, spiritual protection, and the preparation of neophytes for ritual activities. For instance, Huni Kuĩ healers employ plant-induced purges to remove “panema” (negative energies or blockages), thereby restoring health and social harmony[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3]]. Shuar and Achuar use vomitivos prior to ingesting powerful plant teachers like ayahuasca or tobacco, underscoring the value placed on bodily and energetic purification as prerequisites for visionary insight[(Schultes 1994)[2];(Yanomami: A Forest People 2022)[5]].

The functional scope of purging is broad, encompassing preparation, diagnosis, treatment, and protection:

- Preparation for ceremonies: Vimitivos precede visionary or initiatory rites—e.g., ayahuasca assemblies built around [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and [[Psychotria viridis]]—to clear the body, focus intention, and render participants more receptive to teaching and healing[(Ayahuasca – Wikipedia)[1];(Schultes 1994)[2]].
- Diagnostic insight: Healers (curanderos, pajés) may interpret the purge—its timing, volume, material released, and accompanying sensations—as somatic indices of pathogenic intrusion, sorcery, dietary transgressions, or spiritual imbalance.
- Therapeutic action: Purging is prescribed for respiratory and digestive complaints, fevers, and “heaviness,” as well as for the alleviation of social-affective afflictions construed as envy, fear, or grief. In some lineages, repeated purgas form part of longer dietary protocols that facilitate learning and strengthening.
- Protection and fortification: As prophylaxis, early-morning purges are framed as renewing the body’s defenses and clarifying the senses, safeguarding hunters and travelers.

In mestizo Amazonian healing traditions, particularly within vegetalismo, purgas serve as both diagnostic and remedial interventions. Here, they are utilized to prepare apprentices (dieteros), as part of limpias (cleansings) for patients, or to mark critical life transitions[(Ayahuasca – Wikipedia)[1]]. Urban and rural curanderos may incorporate pharmaceutical emetics or ritualized copious water vomiting, demonstrating both innovation and continuity within changing socio-cultural contexts.

Knowledge of medicinal and emetic plants is traditionally transmitted via apprenticeship, oral storytelling, and ritual practice within family lineages and through broader healing communities[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3]]. In recent decades, interethnic exchange, urban migration, and the increasing interest in Amazonian medicine globally have both threatened and revitalized this knowledge. Efforts toward documentation, biocultural education, and the training of new Indigenous and mestizo healers support the continuity of vomiting and purging practices. However, the risk of acculturation, unsustainable plant harvest, and inappropriate adaptation remain significant concerns[(Schultes 1994)[2]].

Linguistic analyses and ritual poetics further situate purging within a moral-ecological order: terms for “purge,” “vomit,” and “cleanse” are anchored in metaphors of lightening, cooling, and protection, linking bodily states to social concord, hunting success, and the maintenance of right relations with forest beings[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3]].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
While the pharmacology varies by species, the emetic effect is usually attributable to alkaloids or other bioactive compounds present in the plant. For example, Psychotria species contain emetine, a potent emetic agent. However, the symbolism outweighs mere physical action: vomiting is seen as the expulsion of pathogenic agents, “heavy” energies, or negative social influences[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3];(Schultes 1994)[2]]. Linguistic analyses reveal that the terms for “purge,” “vomit,” and “cleanse” are often metaphorically linked with ideas of renewal, protection, and social restoration.

From a phytochemical perspective, several modes of action are implicated:

- Direct gastric irritation and peripheral stimulation:
  - Ipecac root (Carapichea ipecacuanha; syn. Cephaelis), historically placed among Psychotria, contains isoquinoline alkaloids (notably emetine and cephaeline) that act as powerful emetics via gastric mucosal irritation and activation of vagal afferents.
  - Saponins and tannins in certain decoctions can provoke nausea through local effects on the stomach lining.
- Central and mixed pathways:
  - Indole alkaloids in Tabernaemontana spp. and related Apocynaceae may contribute to emesis by interacting with central emetic centers while simultaneously producing autonomic effects.
- Non-plant emetics and fluid loading:
  - Water vomitivos rely on rapid ingestion of large fluid volumes to distend the stomach, triggering emesis reflexes; light salting can increase palatability or alter osmolarity within ritualized bounds.

Beyond mechanism, Amazonian healers emphasize complementary dimensions of efficacy:

- Alignment and receptivity: The purge is said to “clear the channels,” allowing songs (icaros), tobacco prayers, or plant teachings to reach the patient without obstruction[(Yanomami: A Forest People 2022)[5]].
- Differential signatures: The taste, texture, and timing of vomit are read diagnostically; “bitter” or “black” purges may index the lifting of sorcery or the leaving of grief, while clear water can signal completion of a preparatory phase.
- Synergy with diets: Extended periods of abstinence (dietas) with neutral or astringent foods are believed to sensitize the body’s response to purgatives and enhance their teaching capacity[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3]].

Importantly, the ritual semantics—the invocation of plant spirits, the prosody of chanting, the social choreography—are not ancillary; they are constitutive of the purge’s therapeutic action as experienced in Amazonian praxis[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3];(Schultes 1994)[2]].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Amazonian communities differentiate between water-based vomitivos and plant purgas, each embedded in specific ritual protocols and bodily disciplines.

- Water vomitivo
  - A common preparation involves the rapid ingestion of large volumes (3–10 liters) of tepid water, sometimes salted or infused with mild botanicals, followed by induced vomiting, either through massage, forced gagging, or gentle encouragement. This form is widely used due to its safety and accessibility[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3];(Yanomami: A Forest People 2022)[5]].
  - Temporality and setting: Typically performed at dawn, often in open-air spaces or near water, with participants facing east to greet first light. Group purging synchronizes breath, song, and movement, reinforcing solidarity and shared intent.
  - Integration with speech and song: Elders may narrate dreams, hunters recount omens, and healers intone icaros as emesis subsides, sealing the cleansing with blessing.

- Plant-based purge
  - Selected emetic plants are decocted or macerated and consumed under the guidance of an experienced healer. The dose, timing, and environmental context are strictly regulated. Ritual protocol may include dietary abstinence, social seclusion, rhythmic chanting, and the application of protective plant baths or smokes[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[4][3]].
  - Degrees of strength: Mild purgas are given to children or convalescents; stronger preparations are reserved for initiates or complex afflictions. Some lineages employ sequential purges over days to modulate intensity.
  - Synergies and sequences: Purgas can precede or follow ceremonies centered on [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] or potent tobacco; the purge is framed as both opening (preparation) and closing (clearing residual heaviness) of ritual cycles[(Ayahuasca – Wikipedia)[1];(Schultes 1994)[2]].

- Ceremonial context
  - Purges are typically conducted at dawn or in the early morning. Group purges reinforce collective ties, while individual purges are prescribed for specific ailments or spiritual afflictions. Healers often sing icaros (healing songs) or invoke the spirit of the plant to deepen the therapeutic process[(Yanomami: A Forest People 2022)[5]].
  - Material culture: Vomit bowls, gourds, clay cups, and leaf bundles serve as ritual implements; aromatic smokes and cooling baths mark transitions.
  - Foodways and abstinence: Avoidance of salt, oils, and sexual activity may be observed before and after the purge. Neutral broths and roasted tubers are taken to ground the body once the purge completes[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3]].

- Regional beverages and dawn practices
  - Ilex guayusa and Paullinia yoco are brewed in early-morning contexts in parts of Ecuador and Colombia; while primarily stimulant and social, such gatherings may integrate emesis as cleansing or as a reset before work and hunting[(Schultes 1994)[2]].
  - By contrast, coca powders such as “ypadu” (mambe) are stimulatory and nutritive rather than emetic, illustrating the diversity of dawn practices across the region and the specificity of purgative logics[(Wikipedia. Ypadu)[10]].

- Urban and contemporary adaptations
  - In towns and cities, curanderos may retain dawn timing and songs while adjusting materials—using bottled water for vomitivos, or sourcing cultivated emetic plants—to align with changing ecologies and access. Some employ pharmaceutical emetics within ritual frames, articulating continuity through prayer and protocol rather than materia alone[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[8]].

Across these variations, the purge is not framed as mere catharsis. It is a disciplined, relational technique: a way to re-tune the body, re-order social space, and re-affirm covenant with plant teachers, spirits, and kin.

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustainable practice of ritual purges requires careful stewardship of emetic plant species, most of which are wild-harvested from vulnerable rainforest habitats. Biocultural rights—including the protection of Indigenous intellectual property and prior informed consent—are increasingly recognized as ethical prerequisites for research, clinical use, or commercial exploitation of purgative plants[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3]].

Key issues and responses include:

- Harvest pressure and habitat change
  - Demand for pharmacopoeial species like ipecac (Carapichea ipecacuanha) has historically led to overharvesting in certain regions. Forest conversion and fragmented landscapes further threaten local supply. Cultivation and community-managed agroforestry can mitigate pressure and secure lineage access[(Schultes 1994)[2]].
- Species identification and safety
  - Rubiaceae and Apocynaceae genera are diverse; misidentification risks ecological harm and adverse outcomes. Herbarium-supported community botany and intercultural training in plant recognition support safer, ethical practice[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[4][3]].
- Protocols, consent, and reciprocity
  - Prior informed consent, benefit-sharing, and adherence to ritual norms are foundational when outsiders participate in or study purgative practices. Documentation and dissemination should honor community approval processes and protect sensitive knowledge, especially diagnostic songs and lineage-specific recipes[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[3]].
- Continuity and pedagogy
  - Apprenticeships, women’s and elders’ councils, and intercultural education programs help transmit emetic plant knowledge in ways chosen by communities themselves. Editorial and curatorial initiatives co-led by Indigenous scholars and healers can prevent distortion and extractivism while supporting living traditions[(Ethnobotany Research and Applications 2024)[8]].
- Plural medical ecologies
  - In pluralistic settings, purgative rituals intersect with biomedical care. Ethical integration entails transparency, non-substitution of essential medical treatment, and respect for local therapeutic reasoning rather than reduction to “detox” metaphors[(Schultes 1994)[2]].

The overarching ethic is one of accompaniment and stewardship: protecting forests and knowledge together, and ensuring that any research, clinical experiments, or commerce around purgative plants proceeds with community leadership, equity, and reverence for ceremony.
