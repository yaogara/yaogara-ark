## Abstract
The Inga and Cofán peoples of the Putumayo region, spanning southern Colombia and northern Ecuador, are among the most recognized custodians of Amazonian plant-based healing practices, particularly through their lineage-based traditions with yajé (ayahuasca)[4]. Their ceremonial use of yajé represents not only a therapeutic tool but also a vital conduit of spiritual knowledge, ecological stewardship, and intergenerational continuity. These communities face significant threats—cultural erosion, language endangerment, environmental degradation, and external exploitation—yet continue to innovate in preserving their ethnobotanical heritage, as documented in archives like the Endangered Languages Archive[1]. This synthesis assembles ethnobotanical, linguistic, and anthropological evidence to outline the significance of Inga and Cofán healing traditions, their cross-border resilience, and the ethical imperatives for their safeguarding. It situates yajé practice within broader Amazonian shamanic lineages while foregrounding the distinctive transnational networks, leadership structures, and cultural self-determination efforts that define the Putumayo context[2][3][4][5].

## Botanical Classification
Yajé is a composite ritual brew, most often comprising the vine [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and leaves from DMT-containing species, notably [[Psychotria viridis]] or [[Diplopterys cabrerana]]. While vernacular nomenclature varies—“yajé” in Colombia and “ayahuasca” in Peru—the core pharmacological ensemble remains the same across many Amazonian traditions[4][9][10].

Key taxa consistently reported for Inga and Cofán ceremonial contexts include:
- Banisteriopsis caapi (family Malpighiaceae): The liana known as the “vine of the soul,” yajé, caapi, or yagé. Primary source of β-carboline alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine).
- Psychotria viridis (family Rubiaceae): A common leaf admixture containing N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), known regionally as chacruna or yagé waira in some lineages.
- Diplopterys cabrerana (syn. Banisteriopsis rusbyana; family Malpighiaceae): A leaf admixture with DMT, regionally known as chalipanga or oco yagé.

Additional plant allies, songs, and ritual accessories vary by lineage, household, and season, reflecting localized ecological knowledge and the healer’s apprenticeship history[4][9]. The selection and proportioning of vines (e.g., sky, black, or tiger caapi as named in some traditions), the maturity of harvested material, and the admixture species collectively shape potency and phenomenological qualities of the brew[9][10]. Within Inga and Cofán practice, the botanical repertoire is embedded in kinship-based custodianship: plants are not merely ingredients but beings, teachers, and guardians whose agency is addressed through prayer, song, and reciprocity[4][5].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
The Putumayo region forms a biocultural corridor linking Andean foothills to Amazonian lowlands, with riverine networks (notably the Putumayo and Napo) facilitating historic trade, kinship, and ritual exchange. The Inga are Quechua-speaking descendants of Inca traders who settled primarily in the Andean–Amazonian piedmont of Putumayo, Caquetá, and Nariño, sustaining a distinct cultural identity while engaging in interethnic exchange with neighboring groups[7]. The Cofán (self-identified as A’i with the language A’ingae) are distributed transnationally along the Putumayo (Colombia) and Napo River (Ecuador), with fewer than 1,200 ethnic Cofán and under 400 speakers of their language in Colombia, many at varying levels of fluency[1][6]. Both groups are recognized by Colombia’s Constitutional Court as at “risk of physical and cultural extermination”[4].

Yajé habitats overlap with evergreen rainforest and piedmont ecotones where [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] is cultivated near households, gardens, or secondary forests, and leaf admixture species such as [[Psychotria viridis]] and [[Diplopterys cabrerana]] are tended or foraged in agroforestry mosaics. The ecological setting—humid tropical conditions, fertile alluvium along river terraces, and canopy stratification—supports both wild and cultivated access to ritual flora. Cross-border residence patterns mean that ceremonies are routinely held on both sides of the Putumayo River, sustaining continuity of practice despite national frontiers and episodes of displacement[3]. This transboundary geography has also shaped mobility and protection strategies in periods of armed conflict, facilitating safe passage for healers and apprentices to maintain lineages[2][3].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Yajé ceremonies remain central to community life, health, and spirituality for both Inga and Cofán peoples, as well as neighboring groups such as the Siona, Coreguaje, and Kamëntsá[2][4]. Ceremonies are led by recognized spiritual authorities—curacas among the Cofán and taitas in Inga traditions—whose roles encompass care of bodies and territories, stewardship of plant allies, and adjudication of social tensions[1][5]. Within this cosmopolitical framework, yajé is not an isolated medicine but a relational practice that attends to individual, community, and forest wellbeing in an integrated manner[5].

Healing objectives span physical, psychological, and spiritual domains, addressing ailments exacerbated by displacement, extractive pressures, and the lingering effects of armed conflict[3]. Ritual spaces support the reopening of social dialogue and promote reconciliation; participants seek guidance for communal decisions, conflict resolution, and ecological management[5]. For the Cofán, the dwindling number of elder speakers and healers has intensified efforts to document, transmit, and revitalize knowledge systems: in the community of Nueva Isla, only five elder curacas remain, underscoring the urgency of apprenticeship and audiovisual archiving[1]. Among the Inga—many of whom have shifted toward Spanish in daily life—yajé practice persists as a marker of ethnic identity and an axis of cultural resurgence[7].

Cross-border lineages are a distinctive hallmark of the Putumayo: families, ritual networks, and student–mentor ties span Colombia and Ecuador, and ceremonies conducted on both sides of the river reinforce shared heritage and mutual obligations[3]. Institutional initiatives reflect this collective orientation. The Union of Traditional Yagé Medics of the Colombian Amazon (UMIYAC) coordinates Inga, Cofán, and allied groups to protect territorial rights, articulate ethical guidelines, and advocate for Indigenous health sovereignty[2][4]. UMIYAC’s platform recognizes yajé as a keystone of biocultural resilience, situating traditional medicine within broader struggles for land, language, and life.

Transmission and continuity are maintained through apprenticeship systems, household participation, and public festivals that interweave song, story, and plant care. Oral tradition remains the primary vector for detailed ritual knowledge; at the same time, new modalities—community-driven video, sound archives, and pedagogical materials—are being developed to support intergenerational learning[1]. Such documentation efforts center consent and repatriation of recordings to communities, acknowledging that language itself (A’ingae for the Cofán) is an archive of ecological and spiritual knowledge now critically endangered[1][8]. Pressures from commercialization and ayahuasca tourism risk diluting practice and misrepresenting lineages, spurring community-led efforts to define boundaries of appropriate engagement and to prevent extractive appropriation[1][5].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Yajé’s psychoactive profile arises from the interaction of β-carboline alkaloids in [[Banisteriopsis caapi]]—notably harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine—with DMT present in admixed leaves such as [[Psychotria viridis]] or [[Diplopterys cabrerana]]. The β-carbolines act primarily as reversible monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors (MAO-A), permitting oral bioavailability of DMT; tetrahydroharmine may also contribute serotonin reuptake inhibition, shaping the temporal and phenomenological contours of the experience[4][9][10]. The resulting altered state is characterized by vivid visual imagery, intensified somatic awareness, and heightened sensitivity to song and sound, all of which are intentionally modulated by ceremonial structure.

Healers calibrate dosage across multiple rounds, pacing ingestion in relation to songs, the fire, and the diagnostic needs of the night. The brew’s preparation parameters—vine age, admixture species, cooking time, and reduction—contribute to variability in onset, intensity, and duration. Within Inga and Cofán frameworks, these dynamics are not merely pharmacological: they are moral and relational, contingent upon the participant’s preparation (dietas and abstinences), intention, and the healer’s capacity to “hold” the space through prayer and song[4][9]. This alignment of chemistry with cosmology underpins the characterization of yajé as a “teacher plant,” a mediator between human communities, the forest, and the spiritual world[4][5].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Ceremonial preparation follows lineage-specific protocols. Vines of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] are harvested, cleaned, and macerated or pounded; leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]] or [[Diplopterys cabrerana]] are selected for vitality and compatibility with the vine. The materials are simmered over several hours—sometimes through cycles of decoction and reduction—under the guidance of a healer who attends to signs from the plants and the fire. Prayers, invocations, and songs accompany each stage, framing the brew as a collaborative act between human kin and plant allies[4].

Ceremonies typically occur at night and unfold in structured phases. Participants gather in a prepared space where the central fire functions as a spiritual ally, focusing attention and illuminating visions during the long hours of ritual[5]. Singing (icaros), storytelling, and guided reflection punctuate the night, with the healer steering the group through diagnostic and therapeutic passages. Emesis and other somatic purges, when they occur, are interpreted as forms of cleansing that restore balance between body, community, and territory. The social dimension is prominent: after visions, participants share insights, analyze communal issues, and seek collective healing paths[5]. This dialogic process makes the ceremony a forum for political imagination as well as personal transformation.

Cross-border lineages actively reinforce continuity. Families and ritual networks maintain houses of medicine on both sides of the Putumayo River, enabling elders to teach apprentices across jurisdictions and ensuring that diasporic kin can return to learn and be treated[3]. This practice has proven adaptive during periods of heightened risk from illicit economies and conflict, when mobility becomes a strategy for safeguarding people and knowledge[2][3]. While patterns of attendance and ritual decorum vary by household, a consistent emphasis is placed on respect for teachers (human and plant), ethical comportment, and the obligations that accompany learning to serve with yajé[4][5].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
The survival of Inga and Cofán healing traditions is inseparable from the integrity of their territories. Deforestation, oil extraction, and mining threaten both the biodiversity that underpins their pharmacopeia and the sociocultural fabric necessary for ritual practice to thrive[3][5]. Territorial fragmentation disrupts access to sacred sites and plant groves, undermines food security, and escalates risks for elders who must travel to teach. In this context, community-led conservation—combining patrolling, restoration, and ceremony—becomes both an ecological and a spiritual imperative[2][4].

Biocultural rights frameworks provide an international basis for protection. Instruments such as ILO Convention 169 and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) affirm collective rights to land, culture, language, and self-determination. Yet implementation remains inconsistent, and state commitments—such as those publicly made during Colombia’s 2019 Minga de Resistencia—have often fallen short, exacerbating vulnerability[5]. Colombian jurisprudence acknowledging the risk of “physical and cultural extermination” for many groups highlights the urgency of translating legal recognition into effective territorial defense and culturally grounded health services[4].

Ethical engagement with yajé traditions requires respect for intellectual property, lineage authority, and community consent. Organizations like UMIYAC articulate codes that reject cultural appropriation and commercialization detached from communal accountability, and they promote protocols for visitors that prioritize reciprocity and harm reduction[2][4][5]. Documentation initiatives, including the Endangered Languages Archive’s A’ingae projects, model participatory methods that return copies of recordings to communities and support local control over sensitive cultural materials[1][8]. As ayahuasca tourism expands, the risk of exploitative intermediaries and misrepresentation grows; Inga and Cofán leaders have responded by reinforcing apprenticeship structures, clarifying ceremonial boundaries, and insisting that learning to serve with yajé is inseparable from commitments to territory, language, and communal care[1][5].
