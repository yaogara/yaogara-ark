## Abstract
Brugmansia spp. (Angel’s Trumpet) are woody perennials in the Solanaceae renowned for large, pendulous, often night-fragrant flowers and for potent tropane alkaloids. Across Andean and Amazonian regions, Indigenous and mestizo practitioners have engaged Brugmansia as a visionary “teacher plant” in circumscribed ritual and healing settings, and as a pharmacologically powerful adjunct to other plant medicines. While ethnomedical applications include divination, initiation, and treatment of select ailments, the plant’s toxicity and unpredictability have long warranted careful, specialist-controlled use (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Schultes et al. 2001; Labate & Cavnar 2014).

This article synthesizes botanical, ethnographic, and pharmacological data on Brugmansia, outlining taxonomy and morphology, distribution and habitat, cultural contexts of use, phytochemical mechanisms, preparation practices, and conservation and ethical considerations. Given the high risk of anticholinergic delirium and life-threatening poisoning, public health concerns and research ethics converge on the need for caution, restricted knowledge transmission, and respect for community protocols (Vázquez 2014; Ulrich-Merzenich 2022).

## Botanical Classification
- Family: Solanaceae  
- Genus: Brugmansia Pers.  
- Representative species: Brugmansia suaveolens, B. arborea, B. sanguinea, among others (Hay et al. 2012)

Morphology and growth form:
- Habit: Woody shrubs or small trees typically reaching up to 5 m in height; branching architecture supports profuse floral display (Hay et al. 2012).
- Leaves: Broadly ovate, often pubescent, with entire to slightly serrate margins; foliage may vary by species and cultivation line.
- Flowers: Large, pendulous, trumpet-shaped corollas measuring roughly 20–50 cm; color forms span white, cream, yellow, peach, pink, and red. A sweet, powerful fragrance intensifies after dusk (Hay et al. 2012).
- Reproductive biology: As with many night-scented Solanaceae, scent and corolla morphology suggest adaptation to crepuscular and nocturnal pollinators; horticulture has further diversified phenotypes.
- Alkaloid distribution: All plant parts contain tropane alkaloids to varying degrees; seeds and flowers are frequently reported as particularly potent (Voogelbreinder 2009; Ulrich-Merzenich 2022).

The genus is closely allied to Datura but is distinguished by its arborescent habit and pendulous rather than erect flowers, among other morphological and phytochemical differences (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Hay et al. 2012).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Brugmansia is native to the Andean foothills and montane regions of western South America, with centers of diversity spanning Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, and parts of northern Chile and adjacent areas (Hay et al. 2012). Historical and contemporary ethnobotanical records from Andean and Amazonian piedmont ecotones describe managed cultivation near settlements, ritual spaces, and gardens, reflecting both medicinal reliance and cultural stewardship (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Hay et al. 2012).

- Native range: Andean cloud forest margins, inter-Andean valleys, and foothill habitats where humidity and temperature regimes support year-round vegetative growth (Hay et al. 2012).
- Cultivation and naturalization: Through horticultural spread, Brugmansia has been widely cultivated and locally naturalized throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and beyond, particularly in frost-free zones (Hay et al. 2012; Ulrich-Merzenich 2022).
- Habitat preferences: Moist, well-drained soils; sheltered aspects with partial sun; consistent access to water; favorable microclimates around homesteads and agroforestry plots. Plants often benefit from riparian proximity and anthropogenic care.
- Phenology: Extended flowering periods in suitable climates enable near-continuous floral production, a trait leveraged in ritual timing by knowledgeable practitioners (Hay et al. 2012).

Several Brugmansia taxa are no longer verified from wild populations and now persist primarily as cultivated lineages. This pattern complicates biogeographic reconstruction and underscores the entanglement of human practices with the plant’s continued existence (Hay et al. 2012; IUCN 2014).

## Ethnobotanical Context
Across Andean and Amazonian cultural landscapes, Brugmansia is known by names such as toé, borrachero, and huacacachu. Accounts from Quechua, Shuar, and other Indigenous and mestizo communities portray the plant ambivalently—as a powerful ally with formidable risks. Within shamanic complexes, it functions as a visionary adjunct and, in some contexts, as a primary agent under strict ceremonial control (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Schultes et al. 2001; Labate & Cavnar 2014).

- Divination and diagnostic insight: Brugmansia is credited with inducing dreamlike or waking-vision states for divinatory purposes, facilitating communication with spirit entities or acquisition of diagnostic information about illness causation and remedy selection (Bianchi 2010).
- Healing and symptomatic relief: Ethnomedical applications include management of musculoskeletal pain, neuralgia, asthma, and rheumatic complaints, often via external or transdermal routes that are perceived as safer relative to ingestion (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Bianchi 2010).
- Rites of passage and training: In initiation or specialist apprenticeship, carefully controlled experiences with Brugmansia may be used to teach, test, or transform the practitioner’s perceptual capacities and spiritual relationships (Schultes et al. 2001; Bianchi 2010).

Brugmansia is frequently integrated with other culturally salient plants. In some traditions, small amounts may be combined with ayahuasca prepared from [[Banisteriopsis caapi]], with the explicit understanding that such admixtures amplify risk and require high ritual competence (Torres et al. 1991; Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Labate & Cavnar 2014). In other settings, it is contextualized alongside stimulant and tonic plants such as [[Erythroxylum coca]], though specific co-use protocols vary widely (Schultes & Raffauf 1990).

Contemporary issues: Due to recurrent reports of accidental and intentional poisonings, knowledge systems surrounding Brugmansia emphasize restrictions on who may handle, prepare, or drink it; the importance of ritual oversight; and the maintenance of esoteric dosage heuristics within lineages (Labate & Cavnar 2014). Outside of traditional contexts, public health literature warns of severe anticholinergic toxicity, unpredictable potency, and dangerous interactions, informing a general trend toward extreme caution or avoidance (Vázquez 2014; Ulrich-Merzenich 2022).

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Brugmansia synthesizes tropane alkaloids with strong anticholinergic properties, notably scopolamine (hyoscine), atropine, and hyoscyamine (Torres et al. 1991; Voogelbreinder 2009; Ulrich-Merzenich 2022). Concentrations and relative proportions vary among species, cultivars, plant parts, phenological stages, and environmental conditions; seeds and flowers are commonly cited as the most potent tissues (Voogelbreinder 2009; Ulrich-Merzenich 2022).

Mechanisms of action:
- Receptor pharmacology: Tropane alkaloids act as competitive antagonists at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Central and peripheral blockade yields the classic anticholinergic toxidrome: xerostomia, mydriasis and blurred vision, tachycardia, urinary retention, decreased gastrointestinal motility, hyperthermia, agitation, confusion, hallucinosis, and delirium (Heiser 1969; Ulrich-Merzenich 2022).
- CNS effects: Scopolamine is especially implicated in central anticholinergic syndromes with prominent amnestic and hallucinatory components, facilitating the vivid, often immersive visionary states reported in ethnographic accounts—yet with pronounced risk of dysphoria, disorientation, and hazardous behavior (Vázquez 2014).
- Pharmacokinetic considerations: Transdermal and inhalational routes can result in systemic exposure; oral ingestion produces variable onset and duration depending on matrix, gastric contents, and individual sensitivity. Traditional reliance on specialist calibration reflects this variability (Ulrich-Merzenich 2022; Bianchi 2010).

Interactions and risk profile:
- Additive and synergistic interactions: Concomitant use with other anticholinergic agents, sedatives, or psychoactives may produce unpredictable outcomes or exacerbate toxicity (Rätsch 2005; Ulrich-Merzenich 2022).
- Admixture contexts: When combined with other Amazonian plants—e.g., small additions to [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] brews—physiological and experiential effects may be intensified or qualitatively altered. Traditionalists emphasize careful titration and divinatory guidance; biomedical perspectives emphasize heightened danger (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Labate & Cavnar 2014).
- Clinical presentation and care: Medical case reports document severe delirium, hyperthermia, arrhythmia, and complications necessitating supportive care; anticholinesterase agents have been used in hospital settings under supervision, underscoring the clinical seriousness of Brugmansia intoxication (Vázquez 2014).

The pharmacological power that makes Brugmansia culturally valuable as a teacher plant is inseparable from its toxic potential. Ethnobotanical practice has thus evolved within a framework of ritual containment, social governance, and hereditary expertise (Schultes et al. 2001; Labate & Cavnar 2014).

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Collection:
- Harvest timing: Leaves, flowers, and occasionally seeds are collected in accordance with ecological indicators and ritual calendars, with attention to plant vitality, lunar phases, and ceremonial readiness (Bianchi 2010; Labate & Cavnar 2014).
- Selection criteria: Practitioners may prefer certain phenotypes or lineage plants reputed for consistent effects; potency signals—such as fragrance intensity—are sometimes heuristically considered alongside lineage knowledge (Bianchi 2010).

Preparation pathways reported in ethnographic and pharmacognostic sources include (with strong caveats regarding risk):

- Admixture to other decoctions: In some ayahuasca practices, minute quantities of Brugmansia tissue are incorporated into brews based on [[Banisteriopsis caapi]], aiming to potentiate visionary content or provide specific diagnostic “clarity.” Such practices are highly circumscribed and controversial due to safety concerns (Torres et al. 1991; Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Labate & Cavnar 2014).
- Aqueous infusions and light decoctions: Brief soaking or low-intensity boiling of leaves or flowers has been reported, with dosages calibrated to the recipient’s status, intention, and experience level—an individualized process controlled by ritual specialists (Torres et al. 1991; Bianchi 2010).
- External and transdermal applications: Topical poultices, macerations in oil or animal fat, and rubs are used for localized pain, rheumatic discomfort, and muscle aches. External application is often framed as safer than ingestion, though systemic effects remain possible (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Bianchi 2010).
- Inhalation and fumigation: Smoke or vapor exposure is occasionally described for respiratory complaints or ritual cleansing, yet such practices are less commonly reported relative to decoctions or topical methods (Schultes & Raffauf 1990).

Ceremonial roles and safeguards:
- Initiatory and diagnostic contexts: Induction of altered states for calling, testing, or honing shamanic abilities; divinatory problem-solving; spiritual negotiations related to illness and misfortune (Bianchi 2010; Rätsch 2005).
- Governance of risk: Strict oversight by initiated specialists, incremental exposure strategies, and careful setting selection reflect communal strategies to manage danger and uncertainty (Labate & Cavnar 2014).
- Knowledge protection: Details of dose, plant-part ratios, and ritual sequencing are frequently protected as lineage knowledge, recognizing both cultural sovereignty and the public health risks of indiscriminate dissemination (Labate & Cavnar 2014).

Contemporary practice trends show reduced reliance on Brugmansia in many communities relative to less hazardous allies, as well as selective retention of external or symbolic uses over direct ingestion. In research and intercultural settings, deference to local protocols and harm minimization principles is paramount (Labate & Cavnar 2014; Vázquez 2014).

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability and status:
- Conservation concern: Multiple Brugmansia taxa are assessed as Extinct in the Wild, persisting as cultivated or feral populations maintained through horticulture and cultural practice (Hay et al. 2012; IUCN 2014).
- Drivers of decline: Habitat conversion, shifts in agricultural and settlement patterns, climate change, and erosion of traditional management all contribute to loss of wild or semi-wild stands and to reductions in associated biocultural diversity (Hay et al. 2012).
- Ex situ and in situ strategies: Botanic garden collections, community nurseries, and on-farm maintenance of culturally important lineages are active fronts for conservation; reintroduction projects aim to stabilize taxa where suitable habitats and community partnerships exist (Ulrich-Merzenich 2022).

Horticulture, safety, and biosecurity:
- Global cultivation: Widespread ornamental planting outside native ranges elevates both conservation opportunities and public safety responsibilities. Clear labeling, education on toxicity, and child/pet exposure prevention are recurrent recommendations in public health and horticultural advisories (Ulrich-Merzenich 2022; Vázquez 2014).
- Identification and misidentification: Confusion with related Solanaceae (e.g., Datura) can complicate ethnopharmacological reporting and clinical response; voucher-based documentation and herbarium collaboration are best practices (Schultes & Raffauf 1990).

Research ethics and community rights:
- Intellectual property and benefit-sharing: Engagement with Indigenous and local knowledge-holders should follow the Nagoya Protocol’s access and benefit-sharing principles and align with contemporary ethical frameworks for ethnobotany, including prior informed consent and culturally appropriate crediting (CBD 2011; Labate & Cavnar 2014).
- Protection of sensitive knowledge: Given the severe toxicity and potential for misuse, publication of procedural details such as precise dosage and potent preparation sequences should respect community determinations about what is shareable and should prioritize safety (Labate & Cavnar 2014).
- Co-produced conservation: Long-term conservation success depends on supporting the living cultural systems that have maintained Brugmansia lineages—integrating community priorities, linguistic and ritual continuities, and livelihood considerations (Hay et al. 2012; IUCN 2014).

In sum, conservation of Brugmansia is inseparable from ethical collaboration with the peoples who have cultivated, named, and interpreted these plants for generations.
