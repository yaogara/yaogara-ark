## Abstract
Rapeh (also spelled rapé or hapé) is a finely ground, intranasal snuff composed primarily of Nicotiana rustica (mapacho) mixed with the alkaline ashes of selected Amazonian trees and plants. Insufflated via a blowpipe into the nostrils, rapeh is central to ceremonial, medicinal, and spiritual life across multiple Western and Central Amazonian Indigenous groups. It is used to sharpen focus, facilitate prayer, purify the senses, clear panema (stagnation, heaviness), and serve as a channel for healing transmission. This article synthesizes ethnobotanical and anthropological perspectives on rapeh and mapacho blends, including botanical constituents, distribution, preparation, ritual contexts, phytochemistry, knowledge transmission, and ethical considerations (Katukina, n.d.; [1]; Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]; Spirit Visions, n.d.; [3]).

## Botanical Classification
Rapeh is a composite botanical preparation rather than a single taxon. Its principal active ingredient is mapacho, a cultivated jungle tobacco, combined with alkaline plant ashes that modulate chemistry, absorption, and symbolic meaning.

- Primary plant
  - Kingdom: Plantae
  - Family: Solanaceae
  - Genus: Nicotiana
  - Species: Nicotiana rustica L. (mapacho)
- Common ash admixtures (selected examples; lineages vary) (Katukina, n.d.; [1]; Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]; Spirit Visions, n.d.; [3]):
  - Tsunu (Platycyamus regnellii, Fabaceae)
  - Murici (Byrsonima crassifolia, Malpighiaceae)
  - Samaúma (Ceiba pentandra, Malvaceae)
  - Cumaru (Dipteryx odorata, Fabaceae)

Additional plants may be included in small quantities according to lineage-specific formulations. Each chosen species contributes both pharmacological and symbolic attributes, and many recipes are guarded as family or communal knowledge (Katukina, n.d.; [1]; Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Rapeh is widespread across the Amazon Basin, with particular prevalence among Indigenous peoples in Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. Notable cultural groups associated with its preparation and ceremonial use include the Huni Kuin (Kaxinawá), Yawanawa, Katukina, Apurinã, Nukini, and Kuntanawa (Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]). Within these groups, use ranges from household, day-to-day practice to structured ceremonial contexts, often alongside other teacher-plant traditions.

Nicotiana rustica is broadly cultivated in swidden gardens and near settlements. The plant tolerates humid tropical conditions, producing leaves high in nicotine and beta-carbolines relative to Nicotiana tabacum. Trees and shrubs used for ash admixtures (e.g., Platycyamus regnellii, Byrsonima crassifolia, Ceiba pentandra, Dipteryx odorata) are native to lowland tropical forests and savanna–forest ecotones; selection is shaped by both ecological availability and longstanding ritual-therapeutic preferences. While some ash trees are common or widespread, others are slow-growing or locally scarce, prompting attention to sustainable practices and seasonal timing of collection (Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).

As rapeh practices have entered cross-cultural exchange, distribution now extends into urban centers, retreat settings, and diaspora communities beyond the Amazon. Yet, within Amazonia, practices remain rooted in local ecologies and lifeways, with harvesting, preparation, and application aligned to ritual calendars and social protocols (Katukina, n.d.; [1]; Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).

## Ethnobotanical Context
Rapeh is embedded in the spiritual, medicinal, and social fabric of Amazonian life. Among the Huni Kuin, Yawanawa, and Katukina, it is administered in private devotion and communal ceremony for prayer, concentration, and healing, and in some contexts as preparation for hunting or other demanding tasks (Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]). In many traditions:

- Rapeh is applied to clear panema—variously glossed as stagnation, misfortune, or a heavy spiritual condition—thereby grounding participants and opening channels for communication with plant spirits and ancestors.
- The exchange of rapeh among kin and guests may function as a gesture of solidarity, respect, and reciprocity, reinforcing bonds within and between communities (Katukina, n.d.; [1]).
- Rapeh frequently accompanies or precedes ceremonies centered on other teacher plants, including ayahuasca, where its concentrating and purifying effects are understood to support visionary work with [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and, in some lineages, [[Psychotria viridis]].

Outside Indigenous contexts, non-Indigenous practitioners have adopted rapeh for meditation, stress reduction, and ceremonial work, often within urban shamanic circles and retreat centers. These expansions have prompted dialogue within Indigenous communities about appropriate transmission, the safeguarding of sacred knowledge, and maintenance of ritual integrity (Katukina, n.d.; [1]; Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).

Historically, tobacco more broadly has held complex roles across the Americas, including medicinal, divinatory, and convivial functions well before European contact (Curtis, 1935; [10]; Elferink, 1983; [6]). Rapeh’s specifically Amazonian forms reflect a distinct lineage of preparation and administration that leverages the pharmacology of N. rustica in combination with alkaline plant ashes to achieve specific effects and ritual ends (Katukina, n.d.; [1]; Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
The pharmacological profile of rapeh derives from the synergy of N. rustica alkaloids and alkaline ashes:

- Nicotine (from Nicotiana rustica): a potent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist with stimulant, analgesic, and mild psychoactive properties. Intranasal delivery enables rapid absorption through the nasal mucosa, contributing to the swift onset of sensory clearing, heightened focus, and autonomic responses such as lacrimation and increased salivation (Katukina, n.d.; [1]).
- Beta-carbolines (e.g., harman, norharman): present in tobacco and implicated in monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition. Although concentrations vary by plant, preparation, and route, these compounds have been discussed in relation to mood-modulating and stimulant actions and for their potential to modulate other alkaloids (Janiger et al., 1973, as cited in Katukina, n.d.; [1]). Analytical studies report beta-carbolines in tobacco matrices and describe MAO inhibition associated with tobacco use (Herraiz et al., 2005; [7]).
- Plant ashes: rich in alkaline minerals that raise the pH of the preparation, thereby increasing the proportion of unprotonated nicotine and facilitating transmembrane absorption across nasal epithelium. The mineral and phytochemical profile of ashes varies by species and burn conditions, contributing to the perceived character of specific blends (Spirit Visions, n.d.; [3]). Within lineage attributions, Tsunu is associated with gentle clearing and centering, while Cumaru is sometimes described as conferring “spiritual protection”; notably, Cumaru contains coumarin, which is hepatotoxic at high doses (Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).

Acute effects commonly reported include transient nasal burning, watering of the eyes, increased mucus production, shifts in vestibular perception, and a rapid transition into a more focused, prayerful, or contemplative state. Physiologically, nicotine can elevate heart rate and blood pressure; cardiovascular sensitivity and nicotine dependence are well-documented considerations for tobacco use in clinical and historical literatures (Russel & Rahman, 2015; [8]). Historical accounts detail both medicinal applications and pleasurable consumption of tobacco among Indigenous societies in the Americas prior to 1492, underscoring its deep cultural embedding and diverse modes of administration (Curtis, 1935; [10]; Elferink, 1983; [6]).

Pharmacodynamic interactions are shaped by the admixture’s alkalinity and by the spectrum of alkaloids present in N. rustica, which tends to exhibit higher nicotine content than N. tabacum. Beta-carboline co-occurrence has led to hypotheses about synergistic psychoactivity and modulation of mood, attention, and sensory gating. While beta-carbolines are MAO inhibitors in vitro and have been implicated in MAO inhibition in tobacco users, the extent to which typical rapeh use produces clinically meaningful MAO inhibition remains a subject of ongoing discussion (Herraiz et al., 2005; [7]; Janiger et al., 1973, as cited in Katukina, n.d.; [1]).

In ceremonial contexts, reported benefits include sharpening of concentration, facilitation of prayer, space-clearing, and the “opening” of the sensory and spiritual field prior to other ritual engagements. These experiential dimensions co-exist with known risks of nicotine dependence, cardiovascular effects, and possible interactions with other substances. Lineage guidance commonly emphasizes moderation, ritual framing, and attentiveness to individual constitution and context (Katukina, n.d.; [1]; Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Preparation is typically collective and ceremonial, guided by pajés (shamans) or other specialists. While practices vary across lineages, shared elements include (Katukina, n.d.; [1]; Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]; Spirit Visions, n.d.; [3]):

- Mapacho leaves are harvested and dried at low heat, then finely ground.
- Selected medicinal woods or plants are burned to ash to provide the alkaline component.
- Tobacco and ash are pounded and mixed in a large mortar over extended periods, often accompanied by prayer, dietary observances, and periods of ritual fast.
- The mixture is sieved through fine cloth and repeatedly reground to achieve a uniform, ultrafine powder.
- Finished rapeh is stored in sealed gourds, bamboo tubes, or crafted containers to preserve freshness and potency.

Administration is intranasal using specialized blowpipes. For self-application, a V-shaped kuripe is used; for shaman-to-participant application, a longer straight tepi allows an experienced practitioner to direct the breath-propelled powder into each nostril. The act of application is often accompanied by traditional songs, prayers, or periods of silence, and is framed as an offering to the plant spirits and a request for clarity and cleansing (Spirit Visions, n.d.; [3]).

Blends are lineage-specific, with recipes maintained as family or communal intellectual property. Example attributions include Huni Kuin Tsunu rapeh, associated with grounding and spiritual clarity, and Yawanawa Murici rapeh, linked to joy and physical stamina (Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]). Sensory and experiential differences across blends are attributed to the botanical composition of ashes, the proportions of tobacco to ash, and the intention and ritual conditions of preparation.

Use etiquette, dosing rhythms, and ceremonial protocols are taught orally and experientially. Effects can be immediate and intense; practitioners typically recommend a stable seated posture, deliberate breathing, and openness to purgative responses such as sneezing or expectoration. In many settings, rapeh is offered prior to or during ceremonies with other teacher plants, where it is understood to “set” the field, sharpen focus, and align participants with the ritual purpose—functions that many communities describe as complementary to ayahuasca practices involving [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and, in some traditions, [[Psychotria viridis]] (Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
The contemporary circulation of rapeh beyond its Indigenous homelands raises intertwined issues of sustainability, intellectual property, and cultural integrity.

- Ecological sustainability: Some ash-bearing trees (e.g., Samaúma, Cumaru) are slow-growing or locally scarce. Sustainable harvesting and species selection, along with attention to regeneration and community forestry practices, are essential to avoid depletion and habitat disturbance (Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).
- Cultural rights and consent: Commercialization risks both dilution of ritual meaning and biocultural appropriation. Best practices emphasize Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) from source communities, transparent agreements, and benefit-sharing mechanisms that return value to cultural custodians (Katukina, n.d.; [1]; Shamans Market, n.d.; [7]).
- Knowledge protection: Recipes, ritual chants, and protocols are commonly held as collective intellectual property and may be reserved to elders or initiated specialists. External documentation and transmission should respect local protocols, avoid divulging restricted knowledge, and acknowledge lineage origins (Katukina, n.d.; [1]).
- Quality and safety: As rapeh enters global markets, variability in sourcing, preparation, and storage can affect safety and efficacy. Community-vetted supply chains, honest labeling, and avoidance of adulterants uphold both consumer safety and cultural standards (Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).
- Economic justice: Fair compensation, community-directed benefits, and long-term partnerships help align external demand with Indigenous priorities, mitigating extractive dynamics and supporting cultural continuity (Katukina, n.d.; [1]; Pharmatropia, n.d.; [2]).

Cross-cultural education has also become a tool for preservation, including audiovisual documentation, ethnobotanical publications, and open-access archives created in collaboration with Indigenous knowledge holders. Such efforts aim to strengthen cultural resilience while promoting responsible, respectful engagement with teacher-plant traditions.
