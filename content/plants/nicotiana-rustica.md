## Abstract
Nicotiana rustica L., commonly known as Mapacho or Amazonian sacred tobacco, is a culturally significant plant widely used among Indigenous and mestizo groups throughout the Amazon basin and Andes. Distinguished by its markedly high nicotine content and rich phytochemical profile, N. rustica occupies a central role in ritual, medicinal, and shamanic contexts. This ethnobotanical review synthesizes current knowledge on its taxonomy, distribution, phytochemistry, ceremonial preparation, and its evolving place in biocultural conservation debates. It further situates Mapacho’s ceremonial functions in relation to other teacher plants, notably in settings where it accompanies preparations of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and, in some traditions, leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]] for ayahuasca practices. The article consolidates available sources on morphology, use, risks, and ethical sourcing, highlighting the plant’s resilience and the necessity of cultural protocols when engaging with its potent pharmacology [1–7].

## Botanical Classification
- Family: Solanaceae  
- Genus: Nicotiana  
- Species: Nicotiana rustica L. [4]

Nicotiana rustica is an annual herb, commonly 1–3 m tall, with soft, glandular-pubescent stems and broad, sessile leaves that can be sticky to the touch. Leaves are typically ovate to elliptic with entire to slightly undulate margins. The inflorescence is a terminal, branched panicle bearing tubular, greenish-yellow to white flowers. The calyx is persistent; the corolla tube is relatively short and dilates slightly at the limb. Fruits are small, ovoid to spherical capsules that dehisce to release numerous minute seeds. The species is readily distinguished from the more widely commercialized Nicotiana tabacum by its stockier habit, leaf morphology, and characteristically higher alkaloid content [1,4].

As with congeners, N. rustica is entomophilous, with floral traits consistent with generalist insect pollination. The plant is well-adapted to nutrient-rich, disturbed soils and demonstrates notable resilience to pests and diseases, a trait historically valued by farmers and forest-garden cultivators. Its robust growth, rapid lifecycle, and high nicotine content have also made it a traditional botanical pesticide in some regions [1,4].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Native to tropical South America—particularly the Amazon basin and eastern Andean slopes—N. rustica has been dispersed widely through Indigenous cultivation, colonial trade, and subsequent naturalization. It is now found across much of the Neotropics, Mesoamerica, and the Caribbean, and has a long history of use in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia (e.g., as “makhorka”), where it was cultivated as a hardy tobacco for local consumption [4]. In Amazonian and Andean contexts, Mapacho is commonly maintained in homegardens (chacras) and swidden fields, where it persists at forest edges and in fertile, well-drained soils [1,2].

Ecologically, the species prefers:
- Disturbed sites with ample light, such as field margins, fallows, and garden plots.  
- Soils ranging from sandy loams to richer alluvials, with good drainage.  
- Warm, humid conditions typical of lowland tropics, though it tolerates a broad climatic envelope and can be cultivated into montane zones where frost is absent or minimal.

Its adaptability and prolific seed set make N. rustica both a cultivated and, in places, an adventive species. The same resilience that benefits traditional cultivation also raises concerns about genetic homogenization if commercial seed lines displace local landraces [1,4,7].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Among Amazonian groups such as the Shipibo-Conibo and Yawanawa, as well as mestizo healers (tabaqueros), Mapacho is regarded as a quintessential “teacher plant,” used for instruction, protection, and the cultivation of practical and spiritual power. Its primary uses include [1–4]:

- Spiritual protection and cleansing: Smoke is blown over individuals, ritual objects, housing perimeters, and ceremonial spaces to purify, bless, and delineate boundaries against malevolent influences. This “smoke medicine” is also applied to plant brews, instruments, and water vessels during preparations [1,3].
- Grounding and focus: Practitioners use Mapacho to enhance concentration, stabilize attention, and modulate affective states before or during ceremonies. In many Amazonian settings, Mapacho accompanies the administration of other teacher plants—for instance, during work with [[Banisteriopsis caapi]]—to steady vision, clarify intention, or “seal” the ceremonial field [2,3].
- Medicinal and purgative applications: Beyond smoke, Mapacho is prepared as aqueous infusions for oral ingestion or nasal insufflation (singado). In controlled ritual contexts, these preparations are used to induce purging, treat intestinal parasites, expel “spiritual intrusions,” and alleviate somatic complaints conceptualized within local etiologies [4–6].

Contemporary practice spans rural and urban spaces. Urban mestizo practitioners and organized retreat settings continue to incorporate Mapacho, sometimes as part of structured apprenticeship regimes (dietas) in which tobacco is ingested or applied under strict guidance to cultivate discipline, energetic protection, and rapport with plant teachers [2,3,5]. While modalities vary, a consistent emphasis is placed on respect for Mapacho’s potency, the role of experienced guidance, and adherence to cultural protocols surrounding intention, song, and abstentions [2,3,6].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Nicotiana rustica is chemically distinguished by its high concentration of nicotine and a suite of minor pyridine and piperidine alkaloids that together underwrite its potent somatic and cognitive effects [4–6].

- Nicotine content: Leaves may contain up to roughly 9% nicotine by dry weight, substantially exceeding typical values reported for N. tabacum (approximately 1–3%). This concentration is a principal driver of Mapacho’s pharmacological intensity and the need for careful dosing in ritual contexts [4].
- Other alkaloids: Minor constituents include nornicotine, anabasine, and anatabine, which are variably present and can contribute to pharmacodynamic effects and toxicity. Beta-carbolines (e.g., harman, norharman) associated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition have been detected in tobacco smoke and may arise via thermal processes; while typically trace-level, they have been discussed as modulators of nicotine’s psychoactivity in combustible products [4–6].
- Pharmacodynamics:  
  - Central and autonomic actions: Nicotine is a potent agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), notably α4β2 and α7 subtypes. Activation produces a complex stimulant profile—enhanced alertness, increased sympathetic tone, modulation of attention and working memory—alongside parasympathomimetic effects. Rapid receptor desensitization and downstream release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine shape both subjective effects and reinforcement [5,6].  
  - Ceremonial phenomenology: In shamanic contexts, practitioners describe Mapacho as focusing attention, “clearing” intrusive thoughts, and facilitating guided visionary states when used alongside other teacher plants. Smoke is believed to carry intention, with ritual blowing practices directing its influence toward specific targets or protections [1–3].  
  - Possible MAO interactions: MAO-inhibiting beta-carbolines associated with tobacco smoke have been examined as partial contributors to the distinct psychopharmacology of combustible tobacco, possibly enhancing dopaminergic signaling and modifying affective tone. These effects remain context-dependent and trace-level in many preparations [5,6].
- Pharmacokinetics and routes:  
  - Inhalation delivers nicotine rapidly via the pulmonary circulation; oral mucosal absorption occurs with chewed or ingested infusions, and nasal mucosal uptake occurs with singado. First-pass metabolism (primarily to cotinine) is significant in oral routes, and kinetics vary with preparation strength and individual tolerance [5,6].
- Risks and interactions: Acute nicotine toxicity presents with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, pallor, sweating, tachycardia or bradycardia, hypertension, and, at higher exposures, seizures and respiratory depression. Traditional practitioners stress precise dosing, titration to individual constitution, and observation to mitigate risk [3,6]. Concomitant use with other stimulating or MAO-inhibiting substances may amplify cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric risks; ceremonial systems address this by timing, dosage constraints, and experienced supervision [5,6].

Given its potency, Mapacho’s pharmacology underscores why ritual training emphasizes discipline, intentionality, and careful stewardship—elements as critical to safety as they are to efficacy within traditional frames [1–3,6].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Mapacho’s preparations range from cured, smokeable rolls to potent aqueous medicines, each associated with distinct ritual aims and somatic effects [1–5].

- Collection and curing: Mature leaves are harvested when fully expanded and aromatic. They are then sun- or shade-dried to reduce moisture before undergoing fermentation (“sweating”) in bundles or wrapped layers. Fermentation deepens flavor, stabilizes alkaloids, and reduces chlorophyllic harshness. The finished leaf is dark, pliable, and strongly scented [3].  
- Rolls (masos): Dried, fermented leaves are tightly hand-rolled into dense cigars or “masos,” a convenient storage and dosing form for ceremonial work. Masos travel well in humid climates and allow practitioners to meter smoke with precision during cleansings and blessings [2,3].  
- Brews and infusions: Leaves soaked in water yield a strong liquid medicine administered orally or via nasal insufflation (singado). Orally, the brew is emetic at modest doses; purging is framed as an intentional cleansing of bodily and spiritual impurities. Nasal administration can be sharply stimulating, clearing sinuses, provoking lacrimation, and inducing transient disequilibrium—effects assessed by healers for diagnostic and protective purposes [4–6].  
- Smoke applications:  
  - Cleansing and protection: Practitioners exhale smoke over the crown, chest, and hands; around altars, instruments, and entrances; and across vessels containing other plant preparations. This practice, widely interpreted as imparting protection and order, often accompanies the singing of icaros and the recitation of prayers [1–3].  
  - Modulation of other plants: In ceremonies with [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and, in some traditions, [[Psychotria viridis]], controlled Mapacho smoke is used to fortify concentration, steady affect, and “seal” intentions or visions. Some lineages abstain from or strictly ration smoke to avoid overstimulation; protocols are lineage-specific [2,3].
- Dietas and apprenticeships: Within training regimens, Mapacho may be ingested or applied topically in carefully calibrated quantities, alongside dietary restrictions and solitude. Such dietas are described as cultivating fortitude, discernment, and protection, and their protocols are guarded by teachers who assess readiness and response over time [2,3,5].

Across these modalities, dosage is individualized, and adverse effects prompt rapid adjustment or cessation. Traditional safety hinges on the practitioner’s skill in reading physiological and energetic signs, a capacity developed through long mentorship and observation [3,6].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability and cultural governance are at the forefront of Mapacho’s contemporary discourse, especially as global interest in Amazonian practices grows [1,2,5,6].

- Sustainability and cultivation:  
  - Ecological robustness: N. rustica is a hardy, adaptable annual. While not currently threatened, pressures can arise from commercial demand, shifts away from diversified forest gardens, and replacement of local seed lines by high-yield introductions. Maintaining traditional cultivation in homegardens and swiddens supports landscape heterogeneity and cultural continuity [1,2].  
  - Landraces and genetic diversity: Many communities maintain distinct Mapacho landraces selected for ritual qualities—aroma, strength, burn characteristics. Seed exchange within cultural networks sustains diversity; indiscriminate commercial seed dissemination risks homogenization. Local propagation and community-controlled nurseries can minimize erosion of genetic and sensory profiles [2,7].
- Cultural rights and biocultural stewardship:  
  - Protocols and sovereignty: Mapacho’s ritual roles, songs, and dosing practices are integral intellectual heritages. With rising demand from retreats and international wellness markets, communities emphasize the necessity of respecting protocols, ensuring informed consent for documentation, and recognizing decision-making authority over ceremonial knowledge [5,6].  
  - Fair benefit and traceability: Ethical sourcing entails transparent supply chains, fair compensation to growers and knowledge holders, and adherence to community-defined terms of engagement. Labels that indicate origin, cultivar, and cultural permissions help prevent misrepresentation and exploitation [5,6].  
  - Health and safety standards: Outside traditional settings, misuse of high-alkaloid preparations can result in serious adverse events. Institutions and facilitators bear responsibility for harm reduction: screening participants, ensuring practitioner training, and aligning practices with both cultural guidance and evidence-based safety principles [5,6].

As a living ethnobotanical, Mapacho exemplifies how plant resilience does not substitute for cultural and ecological care. Stewardship—genetic, ecological, and ceremonial—remains essential to its future in Indigenous territories and in translocal practice networks [1,2,5–7].
