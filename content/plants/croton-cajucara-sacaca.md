## Abstract
Croton cajucara Benth., locally known as Sacaca, is a widely utilized Amazonian medicinal tree valued for its liver-cleansing, adaptogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Sacaca occupies a significant place in both Indigenous and mestizo healing practices as a preparatory plant for deeper dietary rituals (dieta), and is frequently incorporated into community-based phytotherapy for disorders such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, and liver and gastrointestinal ailments (Redda; PubMed; SciELO)[2][3][1]. Ethnobotanical research highlights the ritual and therapeutic significance of Sacaca tea, prepared primarily from leaves and bark, and its role in knowledge transmission and sustainable livelihood among Amazonian populations.

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae  
- Clade: Tracheophyta  
- Order: Malpighiales  
- Family: Euphorbiaceae  
- Genus: Croton  
- Species: Croton cajucara Benth.

Croton cajucara is a narrow-crowned, medium-sized tree typically reaching 6–10 meters in height. Field surveys in the Amazon describe two locally recognized morphotypes—often referred to as the “common leaf” and the “red leaf”—that exhibit distinct anatomical and chemical profiles relevant to medicinal applications (SciELO; Floram)[1][5]. The leaves are generally lanceolate to elliptical, with conspicuous secretory structures; secretory trichomes and idioblasts act as reservoirs for volatile constituents, contributing to the aromatic character of the leaves and bark.

Foliar anatomy underpins the species’ pharmacognostic identity. Studies of leaf structure in C. cajucara lineages highlight variations in trichome density, cuticular features, and secretory cavity distribution that correlate with essential oil yield and composition (SciELO)[1]. These traits are of practical importance for selection of plant material in both traditional and commercial preparations, particularly where organoleptic cues (aroma, resin content) guide harvest.

The morphotype dichotomy has become an organizing principle in regional ethnobotany and phytochemistry. “Red sacaca” is frequently distinguished by its darker foliar pigments and a profile enriched in certain sesquiterpenes and phenolic derivatives, while “common” or “white” forms present a different terpene balance, including higher proportions of monoterpenes in some reports (SciELO; Floram)[1][5]. This chemical and anatomical plasticity is considered an adaptive feature within the genus Croton and informs selection for specific therapeutic aims.

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Sacaca is native to the eastern and central Amazon rainforest, with documented prevalence in Pará, Brazil (Redda)[2]. Ethnobotanical and agronomic sources place the species across lowland humid forest mosaics, where it occurs in secondary forests, forest edges, and managed agroforestry plots. In Pará and neighboring states, Sacaca is integrated into household gardens and smallholder systems as a multipurpose medicinal resource, reflecting its cultural and therapeutic significance (Redda; SciELO)[2][1].

The species’ distribution within the Amazon basin is accompanied by a growing footprint in urban and peri-urban herbal markets. As demand has expanded, nurseries and regional institutions have disseminated planting material, emphasizing local morphotypes and community-based management. Research and extension undertaken by organizations such as Embrapa Amazônia Oriental have encouraged propagation, documentation of morphotype traits, and quality control in plant material used for phytotherapy (SciELO; Floram)[1][5].

Ecologically, Sacaca thrives in warm, humid tropical climates with high annual precipitation and well-drained, nutrient-variable soils typical of Amazonian landscapes. Its capacity to regenerate from coppice and to yield medicinal leaves under sustainable pruning regimes contributes to its suitability for non-timber forest product systems. The prevalence in Pará corresponds with both environmental suitability and vibrant regional medicinal markets that sustain its continued use (Redda)[2].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Sacaca features prominently in the folk pharmacopoeia of Indigenous, Afro-Amazonian, and mestizo communities throughout the Pará region (Redda)[2]. Healers employ Sacaca preparations as cleansers preceding diets (dieta), where it is believed to prepare the liver, modulate metabolism, stabilize blood sugar, and clear toxins, facilitating receptivity to more potent “teacher plants.” In this preparatory role, Sacaca is often consumed prior to or alongside ceremonies associated with teacher plants such as [[Banisteriopsis caapi]], aligning bodily and metabolic readiness with ritual commitments.

Community-based practice situates Sacaca as a versatile medicine for household use and therapeutic consultations. Preparations of Sacaca are commonly used to treat diabetes, cholesterol issues, gastrointestinal, kidney, and liver disorders, and are administered for fever and diarrhea (Redda; PubMed)[2][3]. In contemporary Amazonian herbalism, Sacaca is further processed into powders and capsules, reflecting adaptation to urban and commercial settings. These forms enable standardized dosing and integration into broader phytotherapeutic regimens, while teas and decoctions remain the norm in rural contexts.

Transmission of knowledge occurs through oral tradition, apprenticeship with healing elders, women’s household medicine, and community health networks. Contemporary herbalists and compounding pharmacies have adapted Sacaca into standardized forms—teas, tinctures, capsules—thus extending its reach into urban health contexts while preserving links to regional phytotherapeutic heritage (Redda; SciELO)[2][1]. Agricultural and ethnobotanical initiatives, including participatory cultivation trials and training on harvesting protocols, reinforce intergenerational transmission and provide pathways for younger practitioners to maintain practice continuity amid shifting livelihoods (SciELO)[1].

Medicinal symbolism centers on cleansing, balance, and protection. Sacaca’s role as a pre-dieta cleanser confers the symbolism of a gateway plant, facilitating physical and energetic readiness for more intensive plant teachings. While such symbolism accompanies practice, ethnographic accounts commonly emphasize pragmatic outcomes—improved digestion, stabilized glycemia, and a sense of lightness—experienced by patients who undertake short courses of Sacaca tea prior to ceremonial or dietary commitments (Redda; SciELO)[2][1].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Phytochemical studies reveal that Sacaca’s leaves and bark contain diverse bioactive compounds, notably essential oils with high yields of linalool, aromadendrene, germacrene D, 7-hydroxycalamenene, arabinogalactans, and polysaccharides (SciELO; PubMed)[1][3]. The two morphotypes (“common” and “red”) differ in their dominant terpenes and essential oil composition, with “red sacaca” being especially rich in 7-hydroxycalamenene, a compound with demonstrated antimicrobial, antifungal, and leishmanicidal activities (PMC)[4]. Across studies of Croton species in the region, structural and essential oil production aspects—secretory trichome density, glandular architecture, and phenological timing—co-vary with chemotype and yield, informing selective cultivation and harvest (Floram)[5].

Polysaccharide fractions from Sacaca promote gastric mucosal protection, preserving glutathione levels under stress (PubMed)[3]. In animal models, aqueous polysaccharide extracts have shown gastroprotective effects associated with maintenance of mucosal antioxidant defenses and modulation of inflammatory mediators. This aligns with community practice where Sacaca decoctions are employed for dyspepsia, gastritis, and general digestive discomfort (Redda; PubMed)[2][3]. The contribution of arabinogalactans and related high-molecular-weight fractions underscores the importance of aqueous preparations that extract non-volatile constituents in addition to essential oils.

Essential oil chemistry in C. cajucara is well characterized in the regional literature, with reports detailing variable proportions of monoterpenes (e.g., linalool) and sesquiterpenes (e.g., aromadendrene, germacrene D), as well as phenolic sesquiterpenes such as 7-hydroxycalamenene (DOI: 10.1016/j.sajb.2014.05.006; DOI: 10.1016/j.indcrop.2005.12.004; DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6815)[6][7][8]. The antimicrobial potential of Sacaca essential oil has been documented against bacterial and fungal pathogens relevant to skin and mucosal infections, supporting its traditional external applications (DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2005.03.014)[9]. In vitro cytocidal activity of essential oil from red sacaca against Leishmania chagasi further indicates antiparasitic potential consistent with the presence of 7-hydroxycalamenene and related sesquiterpenes (PMC)[4].

Chemotype-dependent variability necessitates attention to plant identity and morphotype when translating ethnopharmacological knowledge into clinical or commercial contexts. Investigations comparing morphotypes have noted differences in pH values, volatiles, and phenolic content that may underlie distinct therapeutic profiles (DOI: 10.1016/j.indcrop.2005.12.004; DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6815)[7][8]. While both morphotypes are used interchangeably in some communities, practitioners with lineage-specific training often distinguish between them based on symptom patterns and desired pharmacological effects.

Pharmacodynamically, the essential oil constituents plausibly contribute anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, and antimicrobial effects, whereas the polysaccharide-rich aqueous fractions support mucosal protection and metabolic modulation. This division of activity supports the coexistence of decoctions and tinctures within practice. Ethnophysiological interpretations align Sacaca’s “cleaning” action with improved hepatic and biliary function, glycemic balance, and reduced inflammatory burden, providing a conceptual bridge between traditional indications and observed biochemical activities (Redda; PubMed; SciELO)[2][3][1].

Beyond direct medicinal use, essential oils from C. cajucara have been explored as an alternative to threatened aromatic resources such as rosewood, reflecting compatible olfactory profiles and renewable production through leaf harvest (DOI: 10.1023/B:PHAM.0000014683.07039.61)[10]. This line of research embeds Sacaca within broader Amazonian bioeconomy strategies where pharmacological and perfumery applications overlap.

## Traditional Preparation and Use
The leaves and bark of Sacaca are harvested, dried, and prepared as decoctions or herbal teas. Teas are customarily consumed in the mornings or before ceremonial diets, sometimes in conjunction with other cleansing herbs (Redda)[2]. Courses may range from a few days to several weeks depending on purpose—short “cleaning” cycles before entering dieta, or longer regimens for metabolic conditions—guided by healer assessment and patient response. In ritual contexts involving teacher plants such as [[Banisteriopsis caapi]], the act of drinking Sacaca tea is accompanied by intentions of purification and facilitation of metabolic balance, though these practices are framed pragmatically in most ethnographic accounts.

Preparation methods emphasize gentle simmering to extract both volatile and non-volatile constituents. A common household practice involves simmering dried leaf and thin bark strips in water for 10–20 minutes, allowing the infusion to cool before consumption. Where lighter preparations are preferred, brief steeping of crushed leaf suffices for daily tonic use; for digestive complaints or pre-dieta cleansing, longer decoctions may be favored to retrieve polysaccharide fractions implicated in gastroprotection (PubMed)[3]. Some healers blend Sacaca with adjunct herbs recognized for complementary actions—aromatic carminatives, mild diuretics, or bitters—tailored to individual constitutions (Redda)[2].

External applications include washes and compresses prepared from concentrated decoctions for skin irritations and minor infections, consistent with the essential oil’s antimicrobial properties (DOI: 10.1016/j.jep.2005.03.014)[9]. In lineage practice, extract preparations may also be ingested to address specific conditions, including gastric ulcers, where aqueous polysaccharide fractions have shown demonstrable gastroprotective effects (PubMed)[3]. Commercial preparations—powders, tinctures, capsules—allow standardized dosing and integration with biomedical care, and are increasingly available through compounding pharmacies and urban herbal outlets (Redda)[2].

As with other strongly aromatic Euphorbiaceae, practitioners emphasize moderation, quality of plant material, and attention to individual tolerance. In the context of dieta, Sacaca intake is aligned with dietary restrictions—simple foods, minimal fats, avoidance of stimulants—to support hepatic rest and metabolic steadiness prior to engagement with more potent medicines.

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sacaca is integral to Amazonian non-timber forest product economies and is considered a model species for sustainable extraction, thanks to its renewable leaf harvest (SciELO)[1]. Community-based management links Sacaca’s conservation with household income, supporting biodiversity and reinforcing traditional stewardship practices. By prioritizing leaf and twig harvesting over bark stripping from live trees, communities maintain plant vigor and continuous yield, aligning conservation goals with therapeutic access.

Ethical concerns center on biocultural rights, equitable benefit-sharing, and safeguarding traditional knowledge from unsanctioned commercial exploitation. Documentation efforts that credit local experts, transparent supply chains, and participatory research with communities are essential to ensure that the benefits from commercialization accrue to knowledge holders and custodians. Regional initiatives—often facilitated by public research institutions and local cooperatives—have advanced protocols for propagation, harvest, and primary processing that respect both ecological rhythms and cultural context (SciELO; Floram)[1][5].

In perfumery and phytochemical industries, Sacaca has been investigated as a renewable aromatic resource and a viable alternative to threatened species such as Aniba rosaeodora (rosewood), advocating for culturally respectful, sustainable bioeconomy models (SciELO)[1]. The compatibility of C. cajucara essential oils with certain fragrance applications, coupled with its ability to yield biomass under careful pruning in smallholder systems, places the species at the intersection of conservation and livelihood agendas. Continued monitoring of market demand, chemotype-specific harvest pressure, and habitat integrity will determine whether Sacaca can serve as a model for balancing trade and tradition across Amazonian landscapes.
