## Abstract

*Psychotria viridis* Ruíz & Pavón (Rubiaceae), commonly known as chacruna or chacrona, is a neotropical shrub of profound ethnobotanical significance within Amazonian traditional medicine systems. This species serves as the principal source of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in ayahuasca, a ceremonial brew utilized by indigenous peoples for healing, divination, and spiritual purposes for millennia. The plant contains 0.1–0.61% DMT in its leaves, along with trace amounts of related tryptamine alkaloids and diverse secondary metabolites including flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and cyclotides[1][2]. When combined with β-carboline-containing *Banisteriopsis caapi*, which provides monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibition, the DMT becomes orally bioavailable, producing profound psychoactive effects mediated primarily through serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism[3][4]. Recent clinical investigations demonstrate promising therapeutic potential for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety disorders, and prolonged grief, with antidepressant effects persisting weeks to months following administration[5][6]. However, increasing global demand has precipitated conservation concerns, including overharvesting, deforestation, and threats to traditional knowledge systems[7][8]. This review synthesizes current understanding of *P. viridis* taxonomy, phytochemistry, traditional uses, pharmacological mechanisms, and conservation imperatives within the context of sustainable ethnobotanical practice and Indigenous rights.

## Botanical Classification

*Psychotria viridis* Ruíz & Pavón belongs to the family Rubiaceae, one of the largest angiosperm families comprising approximately 13,000 species[9]. The genus *Psychotria* sensu lato represents one of the most species-rich genera of flowering plants, encompassing over 2,000 species distributed primarily across tropical and subtropical forests[10][11]. The genus name derives from the Greek *psychē* (mind, soul, or breath) and Latin *viridis* (green, vibrant, youthful), reflecting both the psychoactive properties of certain species and the plant's characteristic verdant foliage[12].

Molecular phylogenetic analyses utilizing nuclear and plastid DNA sequences position *P. viridis* within the tribe Psychotrieae, subfamily Rubioideae[13][14]. Complete organellar genome sequencing reveals a plastid genome of 154,106 base pairs encoding the complete gene repertoire characteristic of angiosperms[13]. Phylogenomic investigations confirm that the genus *Psychotria* comprises a complex paraphyletic assemblage, with *P. viridis* nested within a predominantly neotropical clade[13][14]. Recent taxonomic revisions have transferred numerous species previously classified within *Psychotria* to related genera including *Palicourea*, reflecting ongoing efforts to resolve the polyphyletic nature of this diverse lineage[15].

Morphologically, *P. viridis* is distinguished by several diagnostic features characteristic of *Psychotria* subgenus *Psychotria*: interpetiolar stipules with reddish-brown trichomes positioned above horizontal scars on the stem; opposite, elliptic leaves (5–15 cm × 2–6 cm) with 5–10 pairs of secondary veins; distinctive foveolae (domatia) on the abaxial leaf surface that house symbiotic mites; and terminal inflorescences bearing small white corollas (1–2 mm)[16][17][18]. Fruits are subglobose to ellipsoid drupes (4–6 mm) ripening purple-red and containing two pyrenes with 4–5 dorsal ridges[16].

## Distribution and Habitat

*Psychotria viridis* exhibits a neotropical distribution centered within the Amazon basin of South America[16][19]. The species occurs naturally across extensive lowland rainforest regions of Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, and extending into Central America including Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua[20][21]. Herbarium records and field observations document its presence throughout the western and central Amazon, particularly in association with indigenous territories of the Ucayali, Madre de Dios, and Upper Amazon river systems[22][23].

The species inhabits moist to wet thickets and functions as an understory component within dense to moderately dense primary and secondary rainforest formations[24]. *P. viridis* demonstrates preference for shaded environments with high humidity, often growing on clayey to sandy soils with abundant moisture availability[25]. The plant typically reaches 5 meters in height with a canopy diameter of approximately 2 meters[16][26]. Field studies document its occurrence from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters elevation, primarily within lowland tropical rainforest zones[24].

Recent investigations of cultivated populations established outside the native range reveal morpho-anatomical plasticity in response to environmental conditions[27][28]. Plants cultivated in extra-Amazonian regions of southeastern Brazil exhibited reduced leaf area, decreased stomatal density, and presence of secretory ducts as adaptations to drier, warmer climates compared to Amazonian conditions[27]. An amphi-hypostomatic leaf pattern, not previously documented for the species, was observed in all cultivated populations studied, suggesting phenotypic flexibility in stomatal distribution patterns[27][28].

The conservation status of *P. viridis* is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)[16]. However, this assessment may not adequately reflect emerging threats from commercial exploitation and habitat degradation in specific regions experiencing intense ayahuasca tourism pressure[7][8].

## Ethnobotanical Context

*Psychotria viridis* occupies a central position within Amazonian ethnomedicinal systems, particularly among indigenous groups of the western Amazon basin. The Quechua designation "chacruna" or "chacrona" derives from *chak* (bridge) and *runa* (person), translating as "bridge between realms" or "to mix," encapsulating the plant's role in facilitating communication between material and spiritual dimensions[12]. Among Shipibo communities, the plant is recognized as an essential component of *nixi pae* (ayahuasca), while Ashaninka groups incorporate it within their broader pharmacopeia of medicinal and ceremonial plants[22][23].

Traditional preparation of ayahuasca involves the decoction of *B. caapi* vine sections together with *P. viridis* leaves through prolonged boiling, often extending over multiple days[29]. Indigenous practitioners, known as *vegetalistas*, *curanderos*, or shamans, recognize distinct varieties of *P. viridis* based on morphological characteristics, particularly the presence and location of glandular structures on leaf undersurfaces[26]. The Machiguenga people of Peru utilize leaf juice as eye drops for treating migraine headaches, demonstrating therapeutic applications beyond psychoactive contexts[26].

Ceremonial use follows strict ritual protocols involving dietary restrictions (*dieta*), sexual abstinence, and spiritual preparation[30][31]. Shamanic healers employ the brew for diagnosing illness, recovering lost souls, defending against malevolent spiritual forces, and accessing knowledge from plant spirits through the singing of *icaros* (healing songs)[32][23]. The Shipibo tradition particularly emphasizes visual geometric patterns (*kené*) experienced during ceremonies, which inform artistic expression and cosmological understanding[23].

Contemporary ethnographic research documents extensive transfer of ethnobotanical knowledge across ethnic boundaries. Ashaninka individuals with greater cross-cultural contact have adopted Shipibo medicinal plants and shamanic practices, including increased cultivation of *P. viridis* near dwellings[23]. This knowledge diffusion reflects dynamic rather than static traditional ecological knowledge systems, adapting to changing social and economic contexts while maintaining core ceremonial functions.

The globalization of ayahuasca practice has resulted in establishment of urban Brazilian religious movements including União do Vegetal (UDV) and Santo Daime, which have secured legal recognition for sacramental use[26][33]. This expansion beyond indigenous contexts raises complex questions regarding cultural appropriation, intellectual property rights, and the distinction between traditional ceremonial use and Western psychedelic tourism[34][35].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology

The pharmacological activity of *P. viridis* is primarily attributed to indole alkaloids, particularly N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), present at concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 0.61% dry mass in leaves[1][36][37]. Additional tryptamine derivatives detected include N-methyltryptamine (NMT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) in trace quantities[2]. Phytochemical analyses employing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have revealed substantial variability in alkaloid profiles between geographical locations, individual plants, and even throughout diurnal cycles[36][2].

Beyond alkaloid constituents, *P. viridis* produces diverse secondary metabolites including pentacyclic triterpenes (ursolic acid, oleanolic acid), steroids (β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, 24-methylene-cycloartanol), glycosylated steroids (3-O-β-D-glucosyl-β-sitosterol), and phenolic compounds (gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ellagic acid, catechin, quercetin, rutin)[1][38]. Recent metabolomic investigations identified flavonoids as primary metabolites differentiating plants grown under varying seasonal and light conditions, with biosynthetic pathways for flavones and flavonols activated in response to oxidative stress from full sunlight exposure[39].

A particularly distinctive class of compounds found in some *Psychotria* species comprises cyclotides—head-to-tail cyclic peptides containing a cystine knot motif that confers exceptional stability[9][40]. While cyclotides from *P. solitudinum* demonstrate inhibitory activity against human prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, their presence and specific activities in *P. viridis* require further characterization[40].

The pharmacological mechanism of ayahuasca depends on synergistic interaction between DMT from *P. viridis* and β-carboline alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine) from *B. caapi*[3][41]. DMT functions as a nonselective serotonin receptor agonist with particular affinity for 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1B/1D receptors, as well as sigma-1 and trace amine-associated receptors[3][4]. Intravenously administered DMT produces effects lasting 10–30 minutes, contrasting with the 4–6 hour duration following oral ayahuasca consumption[3].

β-carbolines provide reversible, selective MAO-A inhibition (IC50: 8×10⁻⁸ M for harmine, 6×10⁻⁸ M for harmaline), preventing first-pass hepatic and gastrointestinal metabolism of DMT and enabling oral bioavailability[3][41]. This contrasts with irreversible pharmaceutical MAO inhibitors, potentially reducing risk of hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome[3]. Additionally, tetrahydroharmine exhibits selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI) properties, while harmala alkaloids demonstrate independent serotonergic activity through 5-HT2A receptor agonism[41][4].

Neuroimaging investigations using positron emission tomography (PET) with [¹⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose reveal widespread cerebral hypermetabolism (15–25% above baseline) following psilocybin administration, a classical psychedelic with comparable subjective effects to ayahuasca[42]. Studies specifically examining DMT/harmine combinations demonstrate significant 5-HT2A receptor occupancy, with ketanserin (a 5-HT2A antagonist) attenuating psychotropic responses, confirming this receptor's primacy in mediating psychedelic phenomena[4][42].

Clinical trials investigating ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression have documented rapid, substantial, and sustained antidepressant effects[5][43]. A randomized placebo-controlled trial reported statistically significant reductions of up to 82% in depressive scores at 1, 7, and 21 days post-administration, with 78% of participants reporting depression as "very much improved" or "completely resolved"[5]. Mechanisms implicated include enhanced neuroplasticity via brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) upregulation, promotion of neurogenesis, modulation of default mode network connectivity, and trauma memory reconsolidation[4][5][6].

Emerging evidence suggests therapeutic benefit for anxiety disorders (70% reporting substantial improvement), post-traumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder, and substance use disorders[5][6]. A controlled trial of ayahuasca-assisted meaning reconstruction therapy for grief demonstrated significantly decreased severity sustained over one-year follow-up, representing the first prospective assessment of ayahuasca for bereavement[6][44].

## Traditional Preparation and Use

Traditional ayahuasca preparation represents a ritualized process transmitted through generations of shamanic lineages across Amazonian cultures[29][30]. The fundamental procedure involves maceration and prolonged decoction of *B. caapi* vine sections with fresh *P. viridis* leaves, though considerable variation exists among practitioners regarding additional admixture plants (*plantas maestras*), proportions, and ceremonial protocols[29][32].

Harvesting follows specific temporal and ritual guidelines. Shipibo tradition prescribes collecting *P. viridis* leaves at sunrise accompanied by prayers acknowledging plant spirits[29]. The *B. caapi* vine undergoes meticulous cleaning with wooden implements and pounding with wooden mallets until fibers separate[29]. Preparation typically proceeds over multiple days, with plant materials added to water and boiled until volume reduces by approximately half, then combined and further concentrated[29].

Final brew composition exhibits substantial variability in alkaloid content. Analysis of 36 *P. viridis* samples from 22 Brazilian sites revealed a broad distribution of DMT concentrations, with some samples containing little to no detectable DMT despite morphological identification as *P. viridis*[36]. Commercial ayahuasca brews analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS) contained DMT ranging from 40 to 5,840 mg/L, with brews prepared from *Diplopterys cabrerana* exhibiting higher DMT content than those using *P. viridis*[2].

Ceremonial contexts emphasize purification through dietary restrictions (*dieta*) extending weeks before and after consumption. Prohibited substances include salt, sugar, fats, fermented foods, alcohol, sexual activity, and specific plant foods[30][45]. These restrictions aim to cleanse the body for optimal interaction with plant medicines and minimize adverse reactions from tyramine-containing foods that could precipitate hypertensive crisis when combined with MAO inhibitors[3].

Ceremonies occur nocturnally within communal spaces (*malocas*) under guidance of experienced shamans who consume larger doses to navigate spiritual realms on behalf of participants[32][31]. Shamans employ *icaros*—melodic healing songs—to direct the experience, call protective spirits, and facilitate therapeutic processes[32]. The Shipibo tradition particularly emphasizes *icaros* as sonic manifestations of the geometric patterns (*kené*) perceived during visions[23].

Physiological effects include nausea and emesis (*la purga*), conceptualized as essential purification releasing physical and spiritual toxins rather than adverse reactions[29]. Additional somatic manifestations may include altered thermoregulation, increased salivation, perspiration, diarrhea, and transient cardiovascular changes[3]. Psychological effects encompass intense visual hallucinations, synesthesia, profound emotional catharsis, ego dissolution, encounters with perceived entities, and experiences interpreted as communication with deceased relatives or plant spirits[32][5].

Integration following ceremonies involves processing insights with shamanic guides and community members, adjusting behaviors and relationships based on revelations, and maintaining dietary restrictions during vulnerable post-ceremony periods[30][45]. Contemporary retreat centers increasingly incorporate psychotherapeutic integration modalities alongside traditional frameworks[6].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations

The exponential growth of global ayahuasca tourism and commercialization presents multifaceted conservation and ethical challenges. In Brazil's Acre state, regulations implemented since 2010 have proven insufficient to prevent overharvesting of *P. viridis* and *B. caapi* from natural habitats[8]. Traditional practitioners report extensive regional depletion, with outside collectors motivated by commercial incentives stripping areas of mature vines and shrubs without regard for regeneration cycles[7][46].

Deforestation associated with ayahuasca production extends beyond direct plant collection. Clearing of Amazonian rainforest for cultivation, road access to harvest sites, and general habitat fragmentation collectively threaten the ecological integrity of regions harboring both plant species and indigenous communities dependent upon them[46][47]. Indigenous Shipibo communities in Peru's Ucayali region lack coordinated reforestation initiatives, with individual healers planting only species they personally utilize[7].

Conservation strategies require multi-stakeholder collaboration integrating indigenous knowledge systems, scientific understanding, and market incentives. Sustainable harvesting protocols emphasize selective collection of mature plants, rotational harvesting allowing regeneration, and protection of natural habitat from destructive practices[46][47]. Cultivation projects offer promising alternatives reducing pressure on wild populations while providing economic opportunities for indigenous communities[48][46].

The BioTrade approach implemented by organizations like Takiwasi Center in Peru demonstrates integrated conservation models. Through participatory forest management plans developed with indigenous authorities and producer organizations, 2,910 hectares of forest under conservation agreements support 74 agroforestry producers from 21 communities[49]. Over 10,000 medicinal plants have been established in indigenous territories, while knowledge collection workshops with 180+ community health practitioners document traditional recipes registered with Peru's intellectual property authority (INDECOPI)[49].

Ethical sourcing frameworks prioritize fair trade principles ensuring equitable compensation for indigenous knowledge holders and plant stewards[48]. Certification systems and third-party audits can verify sustainable practices and transparent supply chains. However, implementation faces challenges including limited regulatory capacity, economic pressures favoring extraction over conservation, and power imbalances between Western consumers and indigenous suppliers[48][8].

Intellectual property rights present complex legal and ethical dimensions. Peru's Law 27811 (2002) attempts to register and protect traditional ecological knowledge, yet critics argue it perpetuates subordination of indigenous knowledge to Western scientific frameworks without addressing root causes of impoverishment or historical injustices[35]. The 1988 Declaration of Belém established principles recognizing indigenous sovereignty over biological and cultural resources, but enforcement mechanisms remain inadequate[50].

The distinction between traditional ceremonial use and Western psychedelic tourism raises questions of cultural appropriation and commercialization of sacred practices[34]. Some scholars advocate centering indigenous philosophies and equitable benefit-sharing rather than extractive research models[34]. The Chacruna Institute and similar organizations promote reciprocity-based relationships honoring indigenous leadership in ayahuasca stewardship.

Biocultural conservation recognizes the inseparability of biological diversity and cultural knowledge systems. Indigenous communities managing forests through traditional practices maintain higher biodiversity and ecosystem services than external management regimes[51][52]. Supporting indigenous territorial rights, strengthening traditional governance structures, and funding community-led conservation initiatives represents a holistic approach addressing ecological and social dimensions simultaneously[51][52].

Future sustainability depends on balancing growing global interest in ayahuasca with protection of source ecosystems and indigenous lifeways. Recommendations include: expanding cultivation of both ayahuasca plants in appropriate regions to reduce wild harvest pressure; strengthening legal protections for indigenous territories and traditional knowledge; developing certification programs for ethical sourcing; educating consumers regarding responsible choices; investing in long-term research documenting ecological impacts; and prioritizing indigenous voices in policy development affecting sacred plants and ceremonial practices[48][46][8].
