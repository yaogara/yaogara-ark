## Abstract
Banisteriopsis muricata, commonly called Red Ayahuasca Vine or Yagé, is a woody liana native to the Western Amazon and closely related to [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]]. It is traditionally incorporated into ayahuasca preparations by Indigenous and mestizo groups in Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, and Brazil [1][3]. The vine is often recognized by its characteristic reddish stem and powder, a trait reflected in local nomenclatures that differentiate “red,” “yellow,” and “white” vines. In Amazonian pharmacologies, B. muricata is regarded as a potent “teacher plant” with a strong ceremonial profile, used for divinatory insight, therapeutic intervention, and communal healing [1][3]. Ethnobotanical accounts and vendor-sourced descriptions suggest a β‑carboline profile broadly similar to B. caapi, with harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine as principal alkaloids and monoamine oxidase A (MAO‑A) inhibition enabling the oral activity of DMT-containing admixtures such as [[plants/psychotria-viridis]] or [[plants/diplopterys-cabrerana]] [1][3][6]. Contemporary interest in red vine variants has prompted questions regarding sustainability, taxonomy, and cultural guardianship, underscoring the need for collaborative conservation and respect for Indigenous knowledge systems [1][3][7].

## Botanical Classification
- Family: Malpighiaceae  
- Genus: Banisteriopsis  
- Species: Banisteriopsis muricata (Cav.) Cuatrec. [5][4]

Banisteriopsis muricata is a perennial, twining liana whose woody stems ascend on host trees for structural support [3]. Vegetative characteristics provide the most reliable field cues, as flowering is infrequent and variable in this group. Leaves are typically smaller than those of B. caapi and often bear a distinctive sheen from silvery trichomes on the abaxial (underside) surface [1][3]. The stems, fresh bark raspings, and dried powders can exhibit a red to reddish-brown hue, a feature that has contributed to its reputation and the common designation “Red Ayahuasca” or “Red Caapi” [3]. When present, flowers are reported to range from greenish-yellow to pale pink or white, aligning with the general floral palette of Malpighiaceae [1][3]. 

Within the Malpighiaceae, Banisteriopsis is a large Neotropical genus revised in modern taxonomic syntheses, with ongoing efforts to stabilize infrageneric relationships using morphological and molecular markers [4][7]. The Steere Herbarium (NYBG) recognizes B. muricata under the authorship (Cav.) Cuatrec., reflecting its historical taxonomic treatment and current usage in herbarium records [5]. As with B. caapi, vernacular naming conventions (e.g., “red,” “yellow,” “white”) in local pharmacologies do not necessarily map one-to-one onto formal species boundaries; rather, they encode organoleptic features, ceremonial reputations, and perceived potency. These emic classifications can correspond to chemotypic or phenotypic variation but may also reflect distinct species or infraspecific variants, complicating straightforward identification in the field [1][3][6][7].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
B. muricata is distributed across the Western Amazon basin, with ethnobotanical and trade accounts placing it in Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, and Brazil [1][3][4]. Reported associations include the Napo region (Peru) and Shuar territories (Ecuador), where the vine is harvested within customary lands and, in some cases, tended in forest gardens [1][3]. Like related ayahuasca vines, it favors moist tropical forests with good drainage, occurring in partially shaded understories as well as more open secondary growth environments where support hosts are available [3]. 

Vendor and ethnobotanical descriptions indicate a preference for nutrient-rich soils and high humidity, with vines frequently found along forest edges and riparian corridors where light and moisture regimes are favorable [1][3]. As with other Banisteriopsis taxa, local abundance can be patchy, shaped by historical tending, disturbance regimes, and cultural harvest patterns. The vine’s occurrence in Indigenous-managed landscapes reflects long-standing practices of selective protection and occasional cultivation, which can shape both spatial distribution and perceived “lineages” of particularly valued vines [1][3]. 

## Ethnobotanical Context
Across Western Amazonian regions, B. muricata functions as a principal or co-principal component of ayahuasca preparations for therapeutic, divinatory, and spiritual purposes [1][3]. Within these traditions, the vine is regarded as a teacher plant—an entity with agency and pedagogy—capable of imparting knowledge, guidance, and healing when approached within established ritual frameworks. Oral histories and contemporary accounts describe its role in diagnosing illness, mending interpersonal or communal tensions, and supporting rites of passage. The plant’s symbolic valence is often indexed by its color designation: red vines are commonly regarded as “stronger” or more incisive medicines, associated with vivid visions and forthright instruction, in contrast with milder or differently “colored” vine types [1][3].

Shuar and other Indigenous groups have articulated distinctions between B. muricata and B. caapi that extend beyond morphology to encompass ceremonial “character,” duration, and bodily effects [3]. Some healers attribute a distinctive clarity or intensity to red vine brews, while others emphasize continuity across vine types, with potency governed more by the healer’s relationship with the plants, the care invested in preparation, and the context of ritual. In both cases, local pharmacologies are relational, attentively differentiating vines by provenance, age, and ceremonial history as much as by botanical markers.

Contemporary practice includes small-group ceremonies guided by experienced healers, who calibrate preparation and dosing to the goals of the session and the needs of individual participants [3]. As ayahuasca has garnered international attention, demand for distinctive vine variants such as B. muricata has risen, creating both market opportunities and cultural risks, including misrepresentation, overharvesting, and dilution or commodification of ceremonial protocols [1][3]. While some Indigenous-led initiatives engage visitors under formal agreements, others highlight appropriation concerns and call for greater respect for intellectual property, traditional knowledge, and local governance of medicinal plants [1][2][3]. Within these debates, B. muricata exemplifies the entwined nature of biocultural heritage, where botanical identity, pharmacology, and ceremony are co-constituted.

Ethnomedicinally, B. muricata preparations are cited for addressing inflammatory conditions, parasitic burdens, and symptoms consonant with depressive states, alongside their broader role in facilitating psychological insight and social repair [1][3]. These reported uses largely overlap with those of B. caapi, though red vine reputations specifically emphasize potency and visionary clarity in some accounts [1][3]. Such claims intersect with emerging pharmacological hypotheses about β‑carboline effects on mood and neuroplasticity, yet remain rooted in local diagnostic systems and ritual therapeutics [6].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Available descriptions and related analyses of ayahuasca vine chemistry identify harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine (THH) as principal β‑carboline alkaloids in Banisteriopsis preparations [1][3][6]. These compounds act as reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO‑A), thereby protecting orally ingested tryptamines—most commonly N,N‑dimethyltryptamine (DMT) from admixtures such as [[plants/psychotria-viridis]] or [[plants/diplopterys-cabrerana]]—from first-pass metabolic degradation [6]. The result is the well-known synergism of ayahuasca: β‑carboline-mediated MAO‑A inhibition combined with DMT’s serotonergic agonism yields a characteristic profile of altered perception, affective modulation, and visionary experience [6].

While direct, peer-reviewed quantification for B. muricata remains limited, ethnobotanical and vendor reports cite β‑carboline concentrations on the order of ~0.11–0.83%, with harmaline and THH commonly emphasized [3][6]. Broader studies of B. caapi and composite ayahuasca brews have documented substantial variation in β‑carboline ratios across samples, suggesting chemotypic diversity, environmental influences, and preparation-dependent outcomes [6]. Such variability provides a plausible substrate for emic distinctions among “red,” “yellow,” and “white” vines, although color categories may capture sensory and ceremonial qualities not reducible to chemistry alone [1][3][6].

Mechanistically:
- Harmine and harmaline contribute RIMA (reversible MAO‑A inhibition), acutely elevating synaptic monoamines and allowing DMT oral activity [6].  
- THH may exhibit modest serotonin reuptake inhibition and 5‑HT receptor interactions, potentially shaping the affective and cognitive tone of the experience [6].  
- β‑carbolines have been investigated for neuroplastic and antidepressant-like properties, consistent with ceremonial reports of mood and insight benefits [6].

Interactions and variability:
- The pharmacological profile of an ayahuasca brew depends on the source vine, admixture species (e.g., [[plants/psychotria-viridis]] leaves vs. [[plants/diplopterys-cabrerana]] leaves), plant age, harvest and processing methods, and decoction parameters [1][3][6].  
- Differences in β‑carboline ratios can influence the onset, duration, and qualitative dimensions of ceremonies, aligning with practitioner observations of varying “strength” among vine types [1][6].  
- Ethnographic accounts emphasize that the healer’s dieta, songs, and ritual stewardship co-determine outcomes alongside chemistry, underscoring the inseparability of phytochemistry and practice in Indigenous frameworks [1][3].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Collection and processing:
- Healers harvest sections from mature vines in forested areas, often following ritual protocols that include offerings and prayers directed to the plant spirit and forest guardians [3].  
- Stems are cleaned, pounded, and shredded to increase extraction efficiency; pieces may be sun-dried or used fresh depending on logistical and ceremonial considerations [3].

Brewing:
- Shredded vine is layered with DMT-containing leaves, commonly from [[plants/psychotria-viridis]] or [[plants/diplopterys-cabrerana]], and decocted over low heat for several hours or through repeated reductions [1][3].  
- The red vine is said to impart a distinctive hue to the brew, and many healers attribute a particularly incisive visionary capacity to preparations dominated by B. muricata [3].  
- Final potency reflects plant selection, ratios, reduction time, and the healer’s intentions; in some traditions, multiple small servings are spaced over a night ceremony to modulate depth and duration [1][3].

Ceremonial context:
- Consumption occurs in structured settings led by experienced practitioners who manage set and setting through songs (icaros), prayer, and environmental controls (light, airflow, seating) to encourage safe navigation of visions and emotions [1][3].  
- The vine is addressed as a plant teacher whose guidance is mediated through dietary observances (dieta), abstentions, and post-ceremony integration, all of which are framed as reciprocal commitments between participants and the forest [1][3].  
- Within collective healing, the brew’s effects are not solely individual; participants often describe shared visions or harmonized states guided by the healer’s song, situating B. muricata within a relational theory of medicine and knowledge transmission [1][2][3].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability:
- Rising global interest in ayahuasca has increased demand for vine material, including rarer or culturally prized variants such as B. muricata, heightening concerns about overharvesting and habitat pressure [3].  
- Indigenous-led and collaborative initiatives promote sustainable protocols, including selective harvesting from mature vines, staggered cutting to allow regrowth, and the establishment of local nurseries and forest gardens [3].  
- When supply chains extend beyond customary territories, traceability challenges can undermine ecological stewardship and community benefit-sharing, necessitating clearer standards and accountability frameworks [1][3].

Cultivation:
- Attempts to cultivate B. muricata outside the Amazon frequently face ecological hurdles involving humidity, temperature regimes, soil microbiota, and host support structures [3].  
- In situ approaches that integrate vine propagation within agroforestry mosaics and secondary forest restoration show promise, particularly when guided by local expertise on planting sites, pruning, and ceremonial tending [3].  
- Conservation planning increasingly contemplates seed banking and the documentation of local lineages, aligning ex situ measures with culturally appropriate control over access and uses [3].

Cultural rights and governance:
- Ethical frameworks emphasize respect for Indigenous intellectual property, guardianship of ceremonial knowledge, and community self-determination over plant use and research agendas [1][2][3].  
- International and national policy discussions are progressively engaging biocultural heritage protections, with taxonomic clarity in Malpighiaceae also supporting better recognition of distinct entities for governance and conservation purposes [2][7].  
- For researchers and practitioners, equitable collaboration entails free, prior, and informed consent; fair compensation; and adherence to locally defined protocols that prioritize the integrity of relationships with the vine, forest, and community [1][3].
