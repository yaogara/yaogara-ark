## Abstract
Plant knowledge in the Amazon is deeply enmeshed in gendered social structures, influencing how ethnobotanical wisdom is acquired, shaped, preserved, and transmitted across generations. Women and men often steward different domains of plant use, contributing to a dynamic and resilient knowledge system that underpins both cultural continuity and adaptive ecological practices. Traditional teacher plants and healing lineages demonstrate this pattern: women predominantly act as transmitters in household health, reproductive care, nutrition, and daily plant management, while men more frequently specialize in ritual, shamanic, and resource-extraction knowledge. These roles are neither fixed nor universal; intergenerational partnerships, apprentice–mentor relations, and community-led education produce a plural, robust framework for plant wisdom, vital to biocultural resilience across Indigenous, riverine, and mestizo societies. The resulting mosaic of vertical, horizontal, and oblique transmission supports ecological stewardship and cultural continuity under conditions of environmental change and social transformation.

## Botanical Classification
Amazonian “teacher plants”—locally construed as plants with medicinal, pedagogical, or spiritual significance—include canonical taxa such as [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] (the vine central to [[ayahuasca]] brews), [[Psychotria viridis]], and resin-producing [[Virola]] species used in snuffs, alongside a broad diversity of shrubs, herbs, trees, and lianas that compose household pharmacopoeias and ritual assemblages [7][1]. Within Indigenous and mestizo contexts, the identity and power of teacher plants are defined less by Linnaean taxonomy and more by their roles within local knowledge systems, gendered spheres of practice, and cosmological orientations that frame plant personhood and agency [6][1].

From an emic perspective, plants are learned through kinship ties, apprenticeship, and ritual encounters. A plant’s classification may hinge on its “teachings” (e.g., its visions, songs, or dreams), its relational behavior (benevolence, danger, or jealousy), and its placement within ceremonial diets or taboos [7]. In this sense, “teacher plant” functions as a social and epistemic category that cuts across families and genera: β-carboline-rich vines like [[Banisteriopsis caapi]]; DMT-bearing leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]]; aromatic and resinous trees; bitter tonics; purgatives; lactagogues; emmenagogues; and a spectrum of wound-healing and antipyretic herbs found in homegardens and forest edges [7][1][6].

While botanical accuracy matters for pharmacological outcomes, local specialists often deploy multivalent classifications that encode efficacy, seasonality, spiritual etiquette, and gendered appropriateness. This layered taxonomy aligns with gendered learning pathways: women’s routine engagement with household and peri-domestic plants versus men’s frequent roles in ritual plant diets, specialized foraging, or long-distance procurement [7][1]. The result is a plant-knowledge complex where formal botanical identity intertwines with social identity and moral-aesthetic values, shaping how particular plants are named, selected, and combined in daily and ceremonial practice [6][1].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Gendered ethnobotanical knowledge spans the Upper and Lower Amazon, encompassing Andean foothills, interfluvial terra firme forests, várzea floodplains, blackwater and whitewater river systems, and mosaic landscapes of secondary forest, swidden fields (chacras), and homegardens. This breadth reflects both ecological diversity and social networks that tie Indigenous nations, riverine communities (ribeirinhos), and mestizo healers through kinship, trade, pilgrimage, and apprenticeship circuits [6][1]. Teacher plant traditions persist across Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Bolivia, while parallel forms of household medicine and ritual healing appear in Guiana shield societies and Amazonian fringes.

Habitats of knowledge transmission are as important as habitats of plants. Homegardens serve as primary sites for women-centered practice and pedagogy—nurseries where seedlings, cuttings, and exchanges among neighbors maintain a living library of remedies [1]. Pathside clearings, riverbanks, and forest margins host opportunistic herbs and shrubs for first aid and daily ailments. Deeper forest zones, often navigated by men, supply bark, resins, fibers, poisons, and rare ritual species accessed through seasonal journeys or specialized expeditions [7][1]. This spatial division is permeable: family collaborations and healer partnerships mean that plant materials and knowledge move across households and habitats.

Urbanization and migration have not extinguished these patterns; rather, they rearrange them. In small towns and peri-urban zones, market stalls and herb vendors mediate access to plants, while community gardens and intergenerational workshops attempt to anchor knowledge locally amid changing ecologies. Such shifts highlight the resilience of gendered transmission—women’s household and neighborhood networks, men’s ritual and foraging circuits, and the role of elders as repositories of memory and technique—even as resource pressures and schooling regimes reshape practice [2][3][6].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Medicinal and ritual plant knowledge is essential across Indigenous, riverine, and mestizo communities. In many settings, women are recognized as primary caregivers and healers at the domestic level, sustaining broad, multispectral knowledge of child health, reproductive concerns, nutrition, and first aid [1][2]. Men often concentrate on ritual, shamanic, or specialized uses, including purge plants, entheogens, and hunting poisons, as well as the navigation of distant forest resources [7][1]. These distinctions are tendencies rather than rules; collaborative husband–wife dyads, intergenerational teaching by elders of all genders, and youth experimentation within community-sanctioned learning spaces are well documented [3][2].

In practice, the “female” domain often includes:
- Household pharmacopeia (herbs and remedies for common ailments).
- Childbirth and women’s reproductive health (e.g., emmenagogues, lactagogues).
- Food plants, wild greens, flavorings, and poisons.

The “male” domain can include:
- Purge plants, entheogens, and psychoactive ritual plants.
- Hunting poisons, resource management, and long-distance foraging.

Yet boundaries are routinely crossed and renegotiated according to family lineage, the prestige of individual healers, emergent socio-economic contexts, and the ethical imperatives of care [1][2][6]. Women participate in ritual programs as preparers, guardians, and, in some traditions, as lead practitioners—especially where midwifery and female initiation rites are central. Men contribute to household medicine through provisioning, gardening, and knowledge exchange. Youth learning reflects both vertical transmission (from parents and grandparents) and horizontal circulation via peers, neighbors, and community projects [2][3].

Apprenticeship models cut across genders. Genealogical descent anchors many lineages, but mentorships also arise outside kin groups (oblique transmission), especially for specialized ritual disciplines associated with [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and allied practices [2]. Community-led education initiatives in Indigenous territories explicitly weave ancestral and modern learning, positioning elders, women’s councils, and youth brigades as co-educators who safeguard territorial health and plant knowledge systems [3][5]. In this sense, ethnobotanical practice is inseparable from governance, land defense, and the right to maintain plural epistemologies.

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Amazonian plant knowledge is simultaneously chemical and symbolic. Household pharmacopoeias emphasize safe, cumulative remedies rich in antipyretic, analgesic, digestive, and anti-helminthic compounds, reflecting iterative testing, observation, and intergenerational refinement [6][1]. Ritual and purge plants may contain potent alkaloids or resins whose effects require specialized preparation and ceremonial protocols. For instance, β-carboline alkaloids in [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] are known as MAO-A inhibitors in biomedical literature, a property that, in ritual contexts, is embedded in broader teachings about diet, abstinence, and relational etiquette. Leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]] are traditionally combined in certain regions; resinous [[Virola]] species are articulated in snuff traditions, with complex preparations that reflect local taxonomies of efficacy and safety [7][1].

Pharmacological action sits within a semantic field in which plants may be personified and gendered—identified as “male” or “female”—and selected accordingly, with taboos and ritual safety guiding combinations, timing, and dietary constraints [4]. Such categories often correlate with plant vigor, morphology, bitterness, or perceived “temperament,” mapping onto pragmatic distinctions (e.g., stronger versus gentler preparations) that address patient age, condition, and context. The co-existence of biochemical efficacy and symbolic reasoning is not paradoxical in local frameworks; rather, it is the basis for nuanced decision-making under uncertainty, especially in environments where clinical infrastructures are distant or unreliable [6][1].

Knowledge transmission therefore involves the learning of plant–human relations, preparation thresholds, contraindications, and the moral dimensions of healing. Women’s emphasis on everyday safety and cumulative care corresponds to pharmacological domains of lower toxicity and steady efficacy, while men’s ritual specializations navigate higher-risk plants with culturally prescribed safeguards [1][7]. Both domains are mutually intelligible and interdependent, producing a resilient division of labor that distributes pharmacological risks and benefits across the community.

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Women’s daily practices typically involve the cultivation, selection, preparation, and administration of medicinal teas, decoctions, bath infusions, poultices, syrups, and foods. The household sphere includes care for infants and elders, reproductive health, wound care, fevers, gastrointestinal complaints, and nutritional supplementation. Plant materials are sourced from homegardens, neighborhood exchanges, riverbanks, and forest margins; when distant or seasonally scarce species are needed, men or mixed groups may undertake procurement expeditions [1][2]. Preparation is accompanied by instruction: naming plants, narrating their histories, and modeling correct harvesting, dosage, and taboos—pedagogies that embed technique in kinship and ethics.

Ceremonial roles, commonly associated with male shamans (ayahuasqueros, curanderos), also involve women as cooks of brews, guardians of dietas, singers, and, in some traditions, leaders of rites—especially where midwifery, reproductive transitions, or women’s healing lineages predominate [7][1]. Ritual programs organize time (fasts, abstinences), space (gardens, rivers, malocas), and social relations (alliances, apprenticeships), encoding practical safeguards into ceremonial form. Ritual plant diets and purge regimens work as training systems as much as healing protocols, aligning sensory learning (taste, smell, kinesthetics) with moral instruction.

Modes of learning intersect with gendered domains. Healer lineages require apprenticeship via:
- Vertical transmission (parent-to-child within families).
- Horizontal transmission (peer learning, neighborhood exchanges, communal projects).
- Oblique transmission (mentorship by elders outside the immediate family) [2].

Mothers, grandmothers, and aunts are principal teachers for domestic medicine, while specialized ritual techniques may be learned from fathers, uncles, or non-related experts of any gender [2]. In documented Brazilian Amazon communities, the maintenance of medicinal knowledge relied on a mix of family teaching and communal (horizontal) learning, with elders—men and women—serving as reservoirs of rare or older plant wisdom [2]. Community-led education initiatives developed with Indigenous organizations reinforce these patterns by creating structured spaces where youth can practice plant identification, preparation, and storytelling linked to territorial defense [3][5].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Gendered plant knowledge anchors cultural identity and underpins conservation strategies. Recognizing women’s centrality to plant management, seed selection, and the distribution of medicinal skills informs policies for sustainable resource use and biocultural rights [2]. Household pharmacopeias and homegardens function as in situ conservation systems, maintaining varietal diversity and ensuring the availability of low-risk, high-utility remedies for everyday care [6][1]. Men’s roles in managing distant forest resources and specialized ritual species complement these systems, linking habitat protection to ritual calendars and territorial governance.

Contemporary pressures—extractivism, land grabs, environmental degradation, and the standardizing effects of Westernized schooling—threaten both transmission models and gendered authority. Community-based schooling and land-based curricula that respect relational epistemologies offer countervailing pathways, integrating ancestral frameworks with scientific literacy and explicitly acknowledging the gendered nature of expertise and teaching [3][5]. Youth networks documented across Amazonian territories demonstrate how horizontal learning and digital storytelling can revitalize plant knowledge while supporting territorial defense [4].

Ethically, documentation and research must attend to intellectual property, fair benefit-sharing, and the rights of communities to control access, interpretation, and dissemination. Equitable partnerships should foreground women’s leadership in governance and health programs, ensure consent processes that reflect community protocols, and support language revitalization as a vehicle for precise plant knowledge [6][2]. Archives like the Yaogará Ark are obligated to represent emic classifications alongside botanical nomenclature, cite community sources responsibly, and design feedback loops so materials remain useful for those who steward the knowledge on the ground.
