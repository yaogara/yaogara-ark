## Abstract
Sacred plant reforestation initiatives in the Amazon represent a convergence of ethnobotanical conservation, cultural revitalization, and intergenerational knowledge transmission. This research focuses on Amazonian nurseries dedicated to the cultivation and restoration of ayahuasca ([[Banisteriopsis caapi]]) and chacruna ([[Psychotria viridis]])—plants central to regional healing traditions and shamanic lineages. These projects are not only ecological responses to the increasing depletion of wild teacher plants through overharvesting, but also community-driven movements to strengthen biocultural heritage, ensuring sustainable access for future generations (Coe 2019; [1], Berlowitz et al. 2021 [3]).

## Botanical Classification
Two botanically distinct species form the core of sacred plant reforestation projects:

- Ayahuasca vine
  - Kingdom: Plantae
  - Family: Malpighiaceae
  - Genus: Banisteriopsis
  - Species: Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C.V. Morton

- Chacruna shrub
  - Kingdom: Plantae
  - Family: Rubiaceae
  - Genus: Psychotria
  - Species: Psychotria viridis Ruiz & Pav.

Ayahuasca is a perennial liana in the Malpighiaceae family, native to the western and central Amazon basin, while chacruna is a shrub in the Rubiaceae family distributed throughout Amazonian lowlands and foothills (Schultes & Raffauf 1992; [4][5]). Both species are critical agents in Amazonian shamanic traditions, with botanical diversity reflected in locally adapted varieties and cultivated landraces across Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, and Colombia ([4], Millard 2020 [5]).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Across the Upper and Western Amazon, community nurseries and replanting efforts are situated in riparian forests, secondary growth areas, and mosaic agroforestry plots where conditions approximate the plants’ native ecologies. Ayahuasca lianas favor humid tropical forest edges and secondary growth where sturdy support trees enable vertical climbing and canopy access; chacruna thrives in partially shaded understories with well-drained soils.

- Regional range: Projects are reported in Peruvian, Brazilian, Ecuadorian, and Colombian Amazonian regions, reflecting both long-standing cultivation practices and contemporary ecological stewardship ([4][5]). The widespread distribution mirrors the plants’ use in Indigenous and mestizo ceremonial contexts and the availability of suitable habitat near communities and riverine transport routes (Schultes & Raffauf 1992; [4][5]).

- Habitat emulation in nurseries: To restore forest-like conditions, nurseries often align planting designs to local climatic regimes—rainfall patterns, soil fertility, shade levels, and wind exposure—so that young ayahuasca vines can establish in semi-wild plots with live supports, and chacruna can develop dense, alkaloid-rich foliage under filtered light ([5]).

- Landscape integration: Reforestation sites commonly integrate with existing chacras (fields) and community forest zones, prioritizing proximity to ceremonial houses and access trails for educational walks and supervised harvests. Such integration enables active management while reinforcing cultural protocols governing how and when plant material is used ([2]; [5]).

## Ethnobotanical Context
Ayahuasca and chacruna are revered among numerous Amazonian Indigenous and mestizo groups, including the Shipibo-Conibo, Asháninka, Kichwa, and Secoya/Siekopai (Millard 2020 [5]; Jauregui et al. 2011 [6]). Traditionally, plant knowledge is transmitted through formal and informal apprenticeships—prolonged periods of plant diets, ritual fasting, and direct mentorship by lineage healers (Luna 1984; [6]). As demand for ceremonial [[ayahuasca]] has expanded globally, the stewardship of wild populations faces mounting pressure, prompting communities to organize their own reforestation and nursery initiatives as forms of both cultural affirmation and ecological defense ([2]; Coe 2019 [1]). For example, Siekopai youth in Sewaya, Ecuador, have integrated audiovisual documentation and medicinal plant gardens to reinvigorate ancestral practices and valorize plant wisdom among younger generations ([2]).

Within this ethnobotanical framework, reforestation projects serve multiple overlapping functions:

- Cultural continuity: Nurseries are spaces where elders transmit prayer forms, songs (ícaros), diet practices, and ceremonial etiquette alongside horticultural skills, ensuring that technical cultivation is inseparable from spiritual pedagogy (Luna 1984; [6]; [2]).

- Identity and autonomy: By cultivating their own stocks of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and [[Psychotria viridis]], communities reduce dependence on external suppliers and markets, strengthening self-determination over ceremonial timing, plant selection, and distribution ([2]; [5]).

- Resilience to external pressures: With intensified ayahuasca tourism and commercialization, nursery programs directly address ecological extraction while centering the custodial rights and responsibilities of local lineages (Coe 2019 [1]; Berlowitz et al. 2021 [3]).

These projects thus underscore that sacred plant stewardship is not merely agricultural; it is a relational practice embedded in cosmology, kinship, and territorial belonging.

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
The therapeutic and visionary properties of ayahuasca brews arise from the pharmacological synergy between the β-carboline alkaloids of the vine and the tryptamines of the leaf admixture:

- Beta-carbolines in ayahuasca vine: Harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine act as reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which slow the breakdown of indolethylamines in the gut and liver ([4][5]). This inhibition renders orally ingested DMT active—otherwise degraded before reaching systemic circulation.

- Tryptamines in chacruna leaves: Chacruna leaf material contains N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a fast-acting psychedelic when made orally bioavailable by the vine’s MAOIs ([4][5]).

- Synergistic effects and cultural framing: While biomedical accounts emphasize receptor pharmacodynamics, Amazonian knowledge systems characterize these plants as “plant teachers” or “madre” plants—agents with intentionality that guide healing, education, and protection (Jauregui et al. 2011 [6]; Millard 2020 [5]). These framings co-exist in nursery practice, where plant selection and handling reflect a convergence of biochemical, sensory, and relational criteria.

- Implications for nursery stewardship: Recognition of chemotypic variability motivates propagation from known mother vines and careful attention to environmental parameters—light, soil, and co-plantings—that influence alkaloid expression and ceremonial efficacy ([5]). The pharmacology therefore informs protocols for cutting selection, maturation timelines, and harvest rotation.

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Cultivation practices in Amazonian nurseries vary between community contexts but generally reflect traditional agroecological knowledge:

- Selection of planting material: Cuttings from mother plants with established ritual efficacy are preferred over seedlings to maintain lineage integrity and desirable vine characteristics (Coe 2019 [1]; Millard 2020 [5]).

- Cultivation environments: Ayahuasca lianas are often intercropped with secondary forest tree species to mimic natural shade and climbing supports, while chacruna is propagated in partially shaded plots to ensure optimal leaf alkaloid content ([5]).

- Integration with community life: Nurseries double as living classrooms, spaces for public ceremony preparation, and educational centers for plant identification, propagation, and ritual etiquette ([2]; Berlowitz et al. 2021 [3]).

Specific preparation of the ayahuasca brew occurs during communal gatherings, with healers overseeing the harvest, synchronizing ritual protocols (songs, intent settings), and preparing the decoction over wood fires ([4]; Jauregui et al. 2011 [6]). In many communities, the nursery plants are reserved exclusively for ceremonial or therapeutic use, reinforcing sacred status and sustainable harvesting norms ([2]).

Beyond horticulture, nursery practice embeds a choreography of ritual attention:

- Ritual alignment: Harvesting is timed to ceremonial calendars and lunar cycles according to lineage customs, with offerings or prayers marking the taking of vine and leaf ([6]; [4]).

- Knowledge documentation: Youth and apprentices engage in participatory mapping of mother vines, cataloguing names, lineages, and perceived effects, often using audio/video records and community archives ([2]; Berlowitz et al. 2021 [3]).

- Social pedagogy: Workshops and guided forest walks introduce plant identification, respectful harvesting techniques, and protocols for preparing and sharing the brew, ensuring that transmission includes both practical and ethical dimensions ([2]).

Collectively, these practices position reforestation not simply as resource replenishment, but as a mode of ceremonial world-making in which cultivation techniques, pharmacological understanding, and cultural obligations are co-constitutive.

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
The intensification of ayahuasca tourism and commercialization has accelerated wild harvesting, at times undermining both ecological resilience and Indigenous access (Coe 2019 [1]; [5]). Sacred plant reforestation projects promote legal, community-based stewardship, supporting the recovery of depleted populations and reinforcing cultural protocols that regulate access and distribution ([2]; [5]). Many nurseries adopt participatory approaches that foreground Indigenous biocultural rights, advocating for the autonomy of custodial communities, and emphasizing free, prior, and informed consent with any external partnerships (Berlowitz et al. 2021 [3]; [2]). Ethical considerations extend to intellectual property and benefit-sharing, as knowledge of cultivation and ritual practice is increasingly sought by external actors in science, industry, and global spirituality (Jauregui et al. 2011 [6]). Calls for robust legal frameworks and cultural respect underpin the movement to secure both the material and intangible heritage of Amazonian teacher plants ([2]; [3]; [5]).

Key considerations include:

- Overharvest mitigation and restoration: Nursery propagation reduces pressure on old-growth vines by providing a steady supply of cultivated material, allowing wild stands to recover and biodiversity to be maintained across landscapes (Coe 2019 [1]; [5]).

- Community governance and FPIC: Decision-making about plant distribution, sales, or collaborations with researchers and retreat centers is anchored in community assemblies and lineage authorities, ensuring that consent processes reflect local norms and priorities (Berlowitz et al. 2021 [3]; [2]).

- Equitable benefit-sharing: When sacred plant materials or associated knowledge generate external value, benefit-sharing mechanisms seek to return a fair portion to custodial communities—supporting nurseries, health, education, and cultural initiatives ([2]; [6]).

- Protection of sacred knowledge: Safeguards against appropriation recognize that ritual songs, diet protocols, and lineage-specific practices are part of intangible heritage, not general public domain, and thus require culturally appropriate permissions for documentation and dissemination (Jauregui et al. 2011 [6]; [2]).

- Long-term ecological monitoring: Sustainable management plans incorporate growth rates, harvest rotations, and phenological observations to calibrate cutting schedules and maintain genetic diversity, often integrating traditional signs with practical metrics like stem diameter and node spacing ([5]).

In sum, sacred plant reforestation is inseparable from ethical frameworks that affirm Indigenous sovereignty, cultural vitality, and ecological care—principles that guide how these plants are grown, shared, and protected.
