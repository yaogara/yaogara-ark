## Abstract
Diplopterys cabrerana (Chaliponga Leaf) is a significant Amazonian vine traditionally utilized in ayahuasca brews among Indigenous cultures of the western Amazon, notably in Ecuador and Colombia. Renowned as an alternative source of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), it is key in pharmacologically potentiating ayahuasca’s visionary effects when combined with [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]]. This article synthesizes botanical, ethnobotanical, and pharmacological insights on D. cabrerana, emphasizing its traditional roles, chemical profile, ceremonial use, and conservation challenges. While regional practices vary, chaliponga is widely distinguished from brews based on [[plants/psychotria-viridis]] in both composition and experiential qualities, and it continues to be cultivated and stewarded by local communities amid ongoing pressures on Amazonian habitats [1][2][9].

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae  
- Order: Malpighiales  
- Family: Malpighiaceae  
- Genus: Diplopterys  
- Species: Diplopterys cabrerana (Cuatrec.) B. Gates [2][3][4]

Morphology  
Diplopterys cabrerana is a robust, woody vine exhibiting a climbing habit typical of forest lianas, with stems described as initially golden-sericeous and becoming smoother with age [1][2]. Leaves are elliptical to falcate, generally 10–21 cm long and 4–9 cm wide, with a glossy, glabrous adaxial (upper) surface and a sparsely hairy abaxial (lower) surface; impressed marginal glands are a notable diagnostic feature in many specimens [2][1]. The plant bears small, greenish-yellow flowers and produces elongated pods with conspicuously winged seeds (samaras), consistent with dispersal syndromes seen in the family Malpighiaceae [2][5]. These morphological traits, along with the climbing architecture and paired leaf glands, assist in field identification and in distinguishing D. cabrerana from sympatric ayahuasca admixture species.

Diagnostic notes  
- Young stems: golden-sericeous; mature stems: smoother bark texture [1][2].  
- Leaves: glossy upper lamina; impressed marginal glands; variable falcate form [2][1].  
- Reproductive structures: small greenish-yellow flowers; elongated, winged seeds [2][5].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Diplopterys cabrerana is native to the western Amazon Basin, with confirmed occurrence in Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Brazil [1][2][8]. It inhabits humid tropical lowland rainforests where it climbs over supporting vegetation in mid- to upper-canopy strata. The species is occasionally cultivated in traditional gardens, especially in eastern Ecuador, where ceremonial lineages maintain living stocks for ritual use and local transmission of botanical knowledge [1][2][8].

Ecology and habitat preferences  
- Biome: evergreen lowland rainforest with high annual precipitation and minimal seasonality.  
- Growth form: liana, exploiting canopy gaps and forest edges to access light.  
- Substrates: well-drained tropical soils; frequently found along riverine corridors and secondary growth where climbing supports are abundant.  
- Cultivation: maintained in house gardens and community plots to reduce pressure on wild stands and to ensure consistent ceremonial supply [1][2][8].

The combination of climbing habit and winged seed morphology suggests reliance on both vegetative propagation (via cuttings in cultivation) and wind-assisted seed dispersal when canopy openings permit. Localized cultivation is reported to buffer impacts from deforestation in some areas, though regional habitat loss continues to present risks to wild populations [2].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Diplopterys cabrerana is integral to ayahuasca traditions in Ecuadorian, Colombian, and some Peruvian and Brazilian Indigenous communities [1][2]. Common names include chaliponga, chagropanga, and oco-yagé; in parts of Ecuador, D. cabrerana is occasionally referred to as “chacruna,” a name more widely associated with [[plants/psychotria-viridis]] in Peru and Brazil [3][9]. Among western Amazonian groups, D. cabrerana is regarded as a master teacher plant and is valued for the distinctive character of its visions and teachings within ceremonial settings [3].

Cultural distribution and practice  
- Indigenous groups such as the Siona, Cofán, and Shuar incorporate chaliponga leaves in healing, divination, and spiritual renewal rituals; use is also documented among some mestizo healers [1][2][6].  
- In Ecuador and Colombia, practitioners often prefer D. cabrerana to P. viridis, attributing a different visionary “voice” or qualitative effect to chaliponga brews [1][9].  
- Ceremonies emphasize the guidance of an experienced curandero or shaman, ritual songs (icaros), and careful adherence to dietary and behavioral norms to support the integrity of the work [2].

Community transmission and contemporary practice  
Despite modernization, ceremonial use of chaliponga persists in local communities and in regional centers. Cultural revitalization initiatives, including the maintenance of teaching gardens and intergenerational knowledge transfer, sustain practices under pressures from land-use change, migration, and the commodification of Indigenous traditions [2]. In these contexts, the choice of leaf admixture—chaliponga versus chacruna—is not merely pharmacological but symbolic, marking regional identity and lineage-specific teachings [1][9].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Diplopterys cabrerana is pharmacologically distinguished by a high content of DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine) and has been reported to contain 5-MeO-DMT (5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), a rarity among common ayahuasca leaf admixtures [1][2]. Trace tryptamines such as NMT (N-methyltryptamine) may be present and could contribute modulatory or entourage effects alongside principal alkaloids.

Principal active compounds  
- DMT: the principal psychoactive constituent enabling vivid visionary and somatosensory experiences when rendered orally active in ayahuasca preparations [1][2].  
- 5-MeO-DMT: a potent tryptamine reported in D. cabrerana that is associated with distinct subjective effects often described as more ineffable or non-visual relative to DMT, though ceremonial reports vary [2].  
- NMT and other trace alkaloids: potential synergists whose roles remain less defined.

Mechanism and interactions  
- Oral DMT is typically inactivated by monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes in the gut and liver, rendering it non-psychoactive when consumed alone.  
- In ayahuasca, the β-carboline alkaloids of [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]]—harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine—act as reversible MAO-A inhibitors, enabling the absorption and central activity of DMT and any 5-MeO-DMT present in chaliponga leaves [1][2].  
- The pharmacological synergy between these β-carbolines and tryptamines yields the prolonged, multidimensional effects characteristic of ayahuasca ceremonies, including vivid imagery, auditory phenomena, emotional catharsis, and somatic purgative responses [1].

Comparative notes with other admixtures  
Traditions that prefer D. cabrerana often highlight qualitative differences from brews using [[plants/psychotria-viridis]], which is typically characterized as DMT-rich without reported 5-MeO-DMT. Whether and how 5-MeO-DMT, if present, shapes the subjective profile of chaliponga-inclusive brews is a matter of ongoing discussion in practitioner communities, with experience shaped by lineage, preparation, dosage, and the specific profile of the accompanying vine [1][2][9].

Safety context  
Given the MAOI component of ayahuasca, consideration of dietary and pharmacological interactions is standard in ceremonial protocols. The presence of multiple active tryptamines in D. cabrerana underscores the importance of experienced guidance and conservative dosing within traditional frameworks [1][2].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Collection  
Leaves of D. cabrerana are hand-harvested from mature vines, with many practitioners preferring the wet season when leaf alkaloid concentrations are considered optimal [2]. Harvesting observes local ecological taboos and customary norms, including rotating collection sites and selective pruning to avoid damage to primary stems and to support regrowth [2].

Brewing  
Chaliponga leaves are typically pounded or shredded and incorporated into ayahuasca brews alongside sections of [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]] vine. Preparations are slowly simmered over several hours—often over dedicated ceremonial fires—until a viscous, brown liquid is obtained [1][2]. Owing to the perceived potency of chaliponga leaves, some lineages report using lower leaf-to-vine ratios than in brews made with [[plants/psychotria-viridis]] [1]. Final decoctions may be reduced for volume standardization and are commonly filtered to remove fibrous material.

Ceremonial role  
Ingestion is conducted under the guidance of a curandero or shaman who sets the ceremonial container through invocations, chanting of icaros, and the use of protective and diagnostic instruments (e.g., rattles, perfumes, or plant smokes) [2]. Participants typically drink in a controlled environment—often at night—with attention to group coherence, safety, and the unfolding of individual processes. Purging is accepted as part of the healing, cleansing, or rebalancing effects of the brew.

Ritual aims and outcomes  
- Healing: addressing physical ailments, psychosomatic conditions, and spiritual imbalances.  
- Divination and diagnosis: accessing insight into community matters, environmental omens, or the spiritual roots of illness.  
- Teaching: cultivating relationships with plant teachers and consolidating knowledge through visionary instruction and dreamwork [1][2].

Knowledge transmission often involves apprenticeship, dietary restrictions, and plant diets that contextualize chaliponga within a broader pharmacopeia of Amazonian medicine.

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability  
Wild populations of D. cabrerana face threats from deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and overharvesting in some regions [2]. To mitigate these pressures, communities and allied organizations implement:  
- Sustainable harvest practices: rotating collection zones, limiting leaf removal to preserve photosynthetic capacity, and pruning strategies that favor vine resilience [2].  
- Community-based cultivation: establishing and maintaining garden stocks and small-scale plantations to reduce pressure on wild stands and ensure reliable ceremonial access [2].

Cultivation  
Chaliponga is increasingly grown in managed gardens for ritual use and as a conservation measure. Vegetative propagation via cuttings supports the maintenance of culturally important lineages and allows practitioners to steward known chemotypes suited to their tradition [2]. Cultivation practices also provide opportunities for youth engagement and intergenerational learning around plant care, ceremonial etiquette, and ecological respect.

Cultural rights and biocultural integrity  
Indigenous peoples assert sovereignty over traditional knowledge, ceremonial practice, and the stewardship of teacher plants such as D. cabrerana. Ethical engagement calls for respecting intellectual and spiritual property rights, obtaining free, prior, and informed consent for any research or commercial activities, and avoiding biopiracy or extractive commodification that disregards custodial relationships and community governance [2]. Alignment with community-led protocols and benefit-sharing frameworks supports the continuity of ceremonial traditions and the ecosystems on which they depend.

Policy and access  
As interest in ayahuasca expands, cross-border legal complexities intersect with conservation. While this article does not address regulatory specifics, ethical practice in research and cultural exchange emphasizes protection of sacred knowledge, biodiversity conservation, and the leadership of Indigenous authorities in decisions affecting their biocultural heritage [2].
