## Introduction

This article is part of the **Yaogará Ark** — a living research archive documenting Amazonian teacher plants, ancestral pharmacology, and the intersection of traditional and contemporary healing knowledge.

Ambil is a concentrated tobacco preparation central to the ceremonial and social practices of Amazonian Indigenous peoples, particularly among the Tukano, Witoto, Bora, and related groups of the Colombian and Peruvian Amazon. Unlike commercial tobacco products, ambil is produced through an ancient reduction process that concentrates the alkaloid content of *Nicotiana rustica* into a thick, dark paste. This preparation is considered a “teacher plant” — a living medicine imbued with ancestral knowledge, intention, and the capacity to facilitate clarity, introspection, and spiritual insight.

In the context of the maloca (traditional communal house), ambil holds profound symbolic significance. **Ambil represents thought, reflection, and the inner word — the masculine principle of order and discernment. Mambe (coca paste) represents speech, expression, and communication — the feminine principle of manifestation and flow.** Together, these two preparations embody a cosmological philosophy that integrates silence and expression, reflection and communication, as complementary forces essential to individual and collective balance.

## Botanical Composition

### Nicotiana rustica: The Sacred Tobacco

*Nicotiana rustica*, known locally as **mapacho** (Tukano), **mói** (Witoto), or **tabaco negro** (Spanish), is a perennial solanaceous plant native to the Andes and cultivated throughout Amazonia for at least 8,000 years. Unlike the commercially dominant *Nicotiana tabacum*, rustica is significantly more potent, containing 2–14% nicotine by dry weight — approximately 5–10 times higher than commercial tobacco varieties.

### Morphological Characteristics

*Nicotiana rustica* is a sturdy, bushy plant typically 0.5–1.5 meters in height, with broad, sticky leaves that exude a distinctive aromatic resin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in terminal racemes, followed by spherical seed capsules containing thousands of tiny seeds. The leaves are broader and thicker than *N. tabacum*, with a darker green coloration that intensifies under cultivation in nutrient-rich Amazonian soil.

### Alkaloid Profile and Potency

The exceptional potency of *Nicotiana rustica* derives from its allotetraploid genome (2n = 48), which confers enhanced secondary metabolite production. The primary alkaloid is nicotine (2–14% dry weight), but rustica also contains trace quantities of other pyridine alkaloids including nornicotine, anabasine, and myosmine. In some traditional admixtures, particularly when combined with plant materials used in other Amazonian preparations, trace harmala alkaloids (β-carbolines such as harmaline and harmine) may be present, contributing mild monoamine oxidase inhibition effects that potentiate nicotine’s action on the central nervous system.

### Traditional Cultivation and Curing

Among Amazonian Indigenous peoples, *Nicotiana rustica* is cultivated in forest gardens and clearings using permacultural techniques that integrate the plant into diverse polycultures. Seeds are traditionally preserved by clan elders, maintaining landrace varieties adapted to local microclimates and ceremonial purposes. Fresh leaves are harvested at peak maturity — typically after the plant has flowered — when alkaloid content reaches its maximum concentration.

Traditional curing involves hanging entire plants or bundled leaves in specialized structures that allow slow, smoke-free drying over 2–3 weeks. This method preserves the plant’s volatile compounds and medicinal properties, contrasting sharply with commercial flue-curing techniques. The dried leaves are then prepared for reduction into ambil, a process accompanied by prayer, song, and intention.

## Preparation Process

### Traditional Production Methods

The preparation of ambil transforms fresh or dried *Nicotiana rustica* leaves into a concentrated, black resin. The process is traditionally performed by elders or shamans within the maloca or in designated preparation spaces, often with ritual accompaniment.

**Step 1: Initial Extraction**  
Fresh or traditionally dried *Nicotiana rustica* leaves are placed in large ceramic or metal pots and covered with water. The leaves are brought to a gentle boil and maintained at low heat for several hours to several days, depending on the desired potency and regional tradition.

**Step 2: Continuous Reduction**  
The extracted liquid is transferred to a separate vessel and heated continuously over moderate to low heat, allowing water to evaporate gradually. This reduction may continue for 6–24 hours or longer, concentrating the alkaloids into an increasingly dark, viscous liquid.

**Step 3: Final Paste Formation**  
As water content diminishes, the liquid transforms into a thick, black resin or paste with a tar-like consistency. The final ambil should be smooth, glossy, and plastic at room temperature — neither crumbly nor liquid.

### Ash Admixtures and Alkalinity

In many traditional preparations, particularly among Tukano and Witoto peoples, plant ash is added to the ambil paste to enhance alkalinity and facilitate buccal absorption of the alkaloids. Common ash sources include:

- **Cecropia** (*Cecropia* spp.), a pioneer tree with nutrient-rich ash  
- **Theobroma bicolor** (native cacao relative, locally *pataxté*), valued for its mineral content and association with cacao-based medicines  

The ash raises the pH of the paste, converting nicotine into its freebase form, which crosses the oral mucosa more efficiently than its protonated form. This increases the bioavailability of the alkaloids and deepens ambil’s grounding, centering effects.

### Ceremonial Context

Ambil preparation is never purely technical. The process is accompanied by songs (*ícaros*), prayers, and meditative states that practitioners believe infuse the medicine with intention and ancestral power. Preparation times are often coordinated with lunar cycles or ceremonial calendars. The elder who prepares ambil may fast, abstain from sexual contact, or observe dietary restrictions to maintain spiritual purity.

## Traditional Contexts and Cosmology

### The Maloca: Sacred Space of Reflection

The maloca is the traditional communal house of Amazonian Indigenous peoples. Within it, ambil and mambe are consumed during evening gatherings and formal meetings, creating a ritualized space for dialogue, contemplation, and transmission of knowledge.

### Ambil and Mambe: Thought and Word

In Tukano and Witoto cosmology, a fundamental duality structures consciousness and social life:

- **Ambil** (tobacco paste) represents **thought, reflection, interior knowledge, and silence**. It is considered **masculine**, associated with fire, sky, and the internal order that precedes speech.  
- **Mambe** (coca paste) represents **word, expression, and communication**. It is considered **feminine**, associated with water, earth, and the outward flow of knowledge into the collective.  

Together, ambil and mambe embody the principle that complete communication requires both thought and word, silence and speech, reflection and articulation. This duality is reciprocal and complementary — one sustains and gives meaning to the other.

### Ceremonial Uses

**Reflection and Mediation:** Ambil facilitates clarity of thought, emotional grounding, and deep listening.  
**Storytelling and Knowledge Reception:** Elders often take ambil before receiving teachings; it is said to open the inner ear.  
**Leadership and Deliberation:** Ambil supports discernment and the internal processing that precedes wise speech.  
**Spiritual Training and Introspection:** Apprentices use ambil to cultivate patience, introspection, and awareness in silence.

## Symbolism and Duality

### Gendered and Cosmological Associations

**Ambil as Masculine Principle**  
- Associated with fire, sky, and the inward movement of energy  
- Linked to thought, silence, and the gestation of knowledge  
- Connected to structure, reflection, and clarity  
- Represents the mental and spiritual order that precedes and grounds expression  

**Mambe as Feminine Principle**  
- Associated with water, earth, and the outward movement of energy  
- Linked to communication, speech, and the manifestation of thought  
- Connected to receptivity, sharing, and expression  
- Represents the creative flow that brings internal knowledge into form  

### Cosmological Integration

This duality is embedded within a cosmology where opposing yet complementary principles — upstream and downstream, night and day, silence and sound — generate equilibrium. The regular consumption of ambil and mambe in the maloca enacts this balance, keeping the community aligned with natural and spiritual rhythms.

### Anthropological Perspectives

Research by **Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff** (*Amazonian Cosmos*, 1971), **Juan Álvaro Echeverri** (*Cool Tobacco, Sweet Coca*, 1997), and **Stephen Hugh-Jones** documents these associations. They emphasize that the duality of ambil and mambe is not merely symbolic but functional — it structures perception, interaction, and ecological knowledge.

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacodynamics

| Compound | Source | Class | Function |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Nicotine | *Nicotiana rustica* | Tertiary amine alkaloid | CNS stimulant; enhances attention, alertness, focus |
| Nornicotine | *Nicotiana rustica* | Secondary alkaloid | Minor CNS activity; metabolite of nicotine |
| Anabasine | *Nicotiana rustica* (trace) | Alkaloid | Weak nicotinic activity |
| Harmala alkaloids (β-carbolines) | Admixtures (trace) | Alkaloids | Mild MAO inhibition; potentiates nicotine effects |

Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, increasing dopamine and acetylcholine activity, leading to heightened attention and calm focus. Ambil’s alkaline pH (from added ash) aids slow buccal absorption, producing sustained, grounding stimulation without the volatility of smoke inhalation.

## Legal and Ethical Context

Indigenous cultivation and ceremonial use of *Nicotiana rustica* often enjoy customary or legal protection under cultural-heritage and biodiversity agreements. UNESCO recognizes the joint practice of mambe and ambil as part of the **Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity** in Colombian Amazonian contexts.

Ethical engagement requires:  
- Respect for Indigenous sovereignty and benefit-sharing  
- Contextualization within traditional frameworks  
- Protection of sacred preparation knowledge  
- Support for Indigenous-led research and conservation

## Conservation and Cultural Continuity

Traditional landraces of *Nicotiana rustica* face threats from commercial varieties, monoculture, and climate change.  
Indigenous initiatives focus on:  
- Community seed banks  
- Participatory breeding  
- Agroforestry integration  
- Youth education and language revitalization  

These efforts preserve both genetic diversity and the ceremonial knowledge surrounding ambil preparation.
