## Abstract
Banisteriopsis caapi var. caupuri (Caupuri Vine) is a potent ethnobotanical variety sourced from Brazilian Amazonia, renowned in indigenous and syncretic ayahuasca traditions for its pronounced psychoactive effects, including intense visionary states and marked physical purgation [1][2]. Esteemed as the "vine of souls," Caupuri plays a central role in collective healing rituals, spiritual practices, and intergenerational knowledge transmission, representing a focal point of cultural continuity and medicinal plant use within Amazonian societies [4][5].

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae
- Family: Malpighiaceae
- Genus: Banisteriopsis
- Species: Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C.V.Morton
- Ethnobotanical variety: var. caupuri (“Caupuri Vine”) [2][4]

Banisteriopsis caapi is a perennial, woody liana whose stems can reach substantial lengths as they ascend supporting trees within humid tropical forests [3][6]. The caupuri ethno-variety is widely recognized by its distinctive macromorphology: large, spherical swellings or “knots” occurring at intervals along the stem, imparting a beaded or rosary-like appearance that differentiates it from smoother-stemmed ethnovarieties such as tucunacá [2][4]. Leaves are opposite, entire, and generally elliptic to ovate; inflorescences form cymose panicles bearing small white to pinkish flowers that in parts of Amazonia typically bloom around January [3][6]. Fruits are samaras characteristic of Malpighiaceae, adapted for wind dispersal, while vegetative propagation by cuttings is common in managed settings [3][2].

Although often referred to as a “variety,” Caupuri is best treated as an ethnobotanical or farmer-selected line rather than a formally described botanical infraspecific taxon. Ethno-varieties are distinguished within Indigenous and practitioner communities by morphological traits, organoleptic qualities, ceremonial reputation, and perceived effects—criteria especially salient to Caupuri’s prestige in ritual contexts [2][4].

The conservation status of Banisteriopsis caapi as a species remains formally unevaluated by the IUCN; in practice, most management of Caupuri relies on vegetative propagation, lineage stewardship, and plot-level agroforestry to maintain desirable traits while reducing pressure on mature wild stands [3][2].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Banisteriopsis caapi is distributed across the western and central Amazon Basin, with occurrences reported from Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru [3][6][7]. The Caupuri ethno-variety is especially associated with Brazilian Amazonia, where its distinctive stem morphology and ceremonial reputation have been documented by regional practitioners and collectors [2][4]. As a canopy-climbing liana, B. caapi typically inhabits humid lowland rainforest and ecotonal edges, establishing at forest margins, riverine zones, fallows, and secondary forest where sunlight breaks through the canopy. Cultivation in homegardens and community-managed forest plots is commonplace in regions where ayahuasca practice is embedded in social and ritual life [3][7].

Outside its core range, B. caapi has been propagated in tropical and subtropical horticulture, although its growth is optimal under high humidity, consistent rainfall, and support structures that permit vertical ascent. In managed settings, Caupuri vines are usually trained onto living or dead supports and periodically pruned to stimulate new growth suitable for decoction. Site selection often emphasizes ecological considerations—such as retaining mother vines, harvesting only mature sections, and spacing plantings to maintain clonal diversity—to ensure long-term availability for ceremonial use [2][3].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Caupuri is integral to ritual and medicinal practices of diverse Indigenous, mestizo, and religious groups across the Amazon biome [1][4][5]. Among the Tukano, Puyanawa, and Huni Kuin peoples—as well as regional syncretic cults, including Santo Daime and União do Vegetal—the vine is revered as both medicinal teacher and ceremonial catalyst [4][8]. Its reputation for producing strongly visionary and deeply purgative ayahuasca brews distinguishes it from less potent varieties, favoring its selection for initiations, healing rituals, and collective spiritual journeys where somatic and affective catharsis are ritually sought [2][4].

In these settings, the vivid psychoactive profile of Caupuri is considered conducive to cleansing at physical, emotional, and psychological levels, facilitating introspection, the reordering of personal and social relations, and the reinforcement of group cohesion [4][7]. The vine’s ceremonial names—such as “vine of souls”—evoke its role as a conduit for ancestral wisdom, contact with spirit beings, and restoration of bodily and communal balance [2][4][7]. The striking, rosary-like stem knots have accrued symbolic potency in myth and ritual discourse, contributing to Caupuri’s prestige within ceremonial economies and its selection by lineage holders for particular types of work (cleansing, initiation, divination) [4].

Knowledge of Caupuri use and preparation is transmitted intergenerationally through oral teaching, ritual apprenticeship, and cross-cultural exchange [2][4]. Lineages maintain protocols governing harvest timing, decoction methods, and ceremonial context, with adaptations extending into urban and diasporic settings via ayahuasca churches and intercultural collaborations [4][7][8]. Ongoing ethnobotanical initiatives—such as those connected with the University of Brasília—are documenting ethno-varieties, refining morphological descriptors, and correlating practitioner knowledge with phytochemical analyses as part of broader efforts in biocultural documentation and sustainable management [4].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
The principal bioactive compounds in Banisteriopsis caapi are β-carboline alkaloids, especially harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine (THH) [3][5]. These constituents exhibit monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitory activity, thereby enabling the oral bioactivity of DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine) co-administered via companion plants such as [[Psychotria viridis]] (chacruna) or [[Diplopterys cabrerana]] (chaliponga) [5][4]. In addition to their enabling role, the β-carbolines are psychoactive in their own right, contributing to the characteristic sensorium of ayahuasca—ranging from tranquility and somatic warmth to vivid oneiric imagery and emesis—depending on dose, ratio, and individual sensitivity [5][4].

Ethno-pharmacological research and practitioner reports suggest that Caupuri may harbor comparatively higher harmine concentrations, a feature often invoked to explain its intense visionary and emetic effects [4]. While specific chemotypes can vary with lineage, environment, and processing, the working consensus among many ritual specialists is that Caupuri’s profile favors fast-rising and somatically forceful experiences, with strong purgation regarded as therapeutically meaningful in certain ritual frames [2][4]. At near-toxic levels, harmine and harmaline can provoke powerful visionary states accompanied by pronounced purging, whereas modest doses are associated with sedation and tranquility [3].

From a pharmacodynamic perspective, harmine and harmaline are reversible MAO-A inhibitors, acutely elevating synaptic monoamines and preventing first-pass deamination of DMT. THH is often described by practitioners as imparting a “softer,” more contemplative dimension; within pharmacological discourse, THH has been discussed for complementary serotonergic actions that may modulate mood and perception alongside harmine and harmaline [5]. Collectively, these alkaloids shape the temporal profile of traditional brews: a gradual ascent following ingestion, a visionary plateau that may last several hours, and a tapering phase during which affective processing and integration frequently occur in ceremonial settings [4][7].

Importantly, β-carboline activity interacts with diet, pharmaceuticals, and personal physiology; ritual specialists calibrate dose and batch concentration with attention to participant sensitivity, ceremonial goals, and safety considerations embedded in local praxis and “dietas” (dietary and behavioral restrictions) [4][7]. Within communities where vine-only (mono) preparations are employed, Caupuri is appreciated for its distinctive purgative and tranquilizing properties, even in the absence of exogenous DMT admixtures [3][4].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Harvest practices for Caupuri are guided by lineage-specific protocols that emphasize respectful engagement with the plant, ecological care, and the intended purpose of the ceremony [2][4]. Vines are typically cut from mature stocks in a manner that preserves mother plants and encourages regrowth; harvested lengths are cleaned, sectioned, and often pounded or shredded to increase surface area prior to decoction [1][2]. Traditional ayahuasca involves combining the vine with DMT-containing leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]] (chacruna) or, in some lineages, [[Diplopterys cabrerana]] (chaliponga), with proportions adjusted by taste, experience, and ritual intent [4][7].

Preparation usually entails slow boiling over several hours, sometimes in multiple reductions, to concentrate alkaloid content into a viscous brown brew [4]. Many practitioners layer vine and leaves, cycling fresh additions into the pot and pressing the plant material to extract sap before straining. The resulting decoction may be reduced to a standardized volume for dosing, cooled, and stored briefly before use. Some lineages prepare vine-only (mono) brews to foreground the β-carboline dimension of the experience; Caupuri is a frequent choice for such preparations because of its distinctive purgative and calming qualities [3][4].

Dosage and batch potency vary by lineage and purpose. Healers calibrate concentration in relation to participants’ experience, the desired arc of the ceremony (e.g., cleansing, initiation, divination, communal healing), and the anticipated duration [4][7]. In many traditions, pre-ceremonial dietas are observed to align bodily, emotional, and spiritual conditions with the work of the brew; these can include dietary restrictions, sexual abstinence, and contemplative practices that frame the ingestion within a broader pedagogy of attention and care [4]. During the ceremony, chants, prayers, or hymns structure the experience; somatic purgation (vomiting, sweating) is interpreted as a meaningful expulsion of impediments, and the brew’s intensity—often accentuated in Caupuri preparations—is sought when deep cleansing is intended [2][4][8].

Contemporary practice extends across diverse settings, from forest malocas to urban temples. Syncretic churches such as Santo Daime and União do Vegetal often maintain their own preparation standards, quality controls, and ritual calendars, incorporating Caupuri into sacramental life according to institutional doctrine and collective experience [4][8]. As ayahuasca circulates beyond the Amazon, experienced facilitators emphasize lineage accountability, respectful sourcing, and safeguards that uphold the plant’s cultural context alongside participant wellbeing [4][7][8].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustainable management of Banisteriopsis caapi—particularly sought-after ethno-varieties like Caupuri—has become a priority as demand increases regionally and globally [4][7]. Locally, vegetative propagation and careful harvest practices reduce pressure on mature stands, with attention to ecological impact and continuity of lineage-specific traits [2]. Community-based cultivation strategies frequently combine agroforestry plots, homegarden plantings, and mother vine reserves, promoting both genetic and clonal diversity while ensuring availability for ceremonial needs [3][2].

Ethical sourcing includes transparent provenance, fair compensation for growers and knowledge holders, and explicit respect for Indigenous custodianship. Within Amazonian societies, the knowledge systems surrounding Caupuri—its identification, selection, preparation, and ritual integration—constitute vital cultural patrimony; equitable collaboration and benefit-sharing are therefore central to research, commerce, and education related to the plant [4][8]. Documentation initiatives that catalog ethno-varieties and correlate them with morphological and phytochemical profiles can support conservation and cultural continuity, provided that data governance recognizes community protocols and safeguards sensitive knowledge [4].

Beyond local stewardship, broader concerns include habitat degradation, overharvesting for export markets, and erosion of traditional knowledge amid rapid global expansion of ayahuasca practices [4][7]. The species’ IUCN status remains unevaluated, but field-based assessments and participatory monitoring can inform pragmatic conservation targets and harvesting guidelines attuned to regional ecologies [3]. Ethical frameworks emerging from practitioner networks and research partners emphasize long-term relationships, consent-based access to plant materials, and shared authorship of knowledge. For syncretic and international contexts, these frameworks also extend to responsible ceremonial facilitation, cultural humility, and reinforcement of ties with Amazonian communities who maintain the living lineages of Caupuri [4][8].
