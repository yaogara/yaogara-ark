## Abstract
Urban ayahuasca circles represent a contemporary syncretic phenomenon connecting city populations with Amazonian teacher plant traditions. These circles translate ceremonial and healing practices rooted in Indigenous Amazonian lineages into urban formats, blending ritual forms, healing lineages, and plant knowledge with Western therapeutic and spiritual frameworks. The result is a heterogeneous field of practice that raises questions of authenticity, ethics, legality, and cultural continuity while offering alternative frameworks for psychosocial healing and spirituality [1][7][2]. In these settings, facilitators may include Amazonian-trained curanderos and shamans, mestizo vegetalistas, neo-shamanic practitioners, and leaders from syncretic ayahuasca churches, operating across South America, North America, and Europe [1][2][7]. Although some circles aim to faithfully maintain ceremonial protocols, others introduce yoga, guided meditation, psychotherapy, and integration practices to accommodate participants’ biographical and psychological needs [3][1]. The psychoactive effects are attributed to β-carbolines in [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) typically from [[Psychotria viridis]], with symbolic interpretations ranging from Indigenous personifications of the brew to urban framings as a tool for self-exploration [6][5][3][1][2].

## Botanical Classification
Urban ayahuasca circles center on a brew known as ayahuasca, traditionally composed of the liana [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and DMT-containing admixtures, most commonly [[Psychotria viridis]] or [[Diplopterys cabrerana]]. While “ayahuasca” designates the beverage and its ceremonial use, the botany underpinning the practice involves multiple species with distinct ecologies and chemistries [6][2][5].

Primary components:
- Banisteriopsis caapi
  - Family: Malpighiaceae
  - Genus: Banisteriopsis
  - Species: Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C.V.Morton
  - Role in brew: Source of β-carboline alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine) that act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, enabling oral DMT activity [6][5].
  - Cultural status: Considered the “mother” or guiding teacher vine in many Amazonian traditions [2][5].

- Psychotria viridis
  - Family: Rubiaceae
  - Genus: Psychotria
  - Species: Psychotria viridis Ruiz & Pav.
  - Role in brew: Leaf source of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the primary visionary tryptamine in most traditional preparations [6][5].
  - Cultural status: Known in many regions as chacruna; paired with B. caapi in numerous lineages [6][5].

- Diplopterys cabrerana
  - Family: Malpighiaceae
  - Genus: Diplopterys
  - Species: Diplopterys cabrerana (Cuatrec.) B. Gates
  - Role in brew: Alternative DMT-containing leaf used in place of P. viridis in some regions [6][5].
  - Cultural status: Known as chalipanga or chagropanga; aligned with specific ethnolinguistic traditions [6][5].

Auxiliary admixtures may be incorporated depending on regional knowledge and ritual aims. Urban circles inherit and adapt this plant palette, though procurement and composition often reflect supply networks and legal contexts far removed from forest ecologies [1][4][6].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
The canonical biogeography of ayahuasca plants centers on the northwest Amazon Basin—Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador—with extensions into adjacent lowland tropical forests [6][2][5]. [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] thrives as a perennial liana in humid tropical rainforest, climbing into canopy light; [[Psychotria viridis]] and [[Diplopterys cabrerana]] are shrubs or lianas in understory to mid-canopy habitats, favoring moist, shaded conditions typical of Western Amazonia [6][5]. Historically, cultivation and wildcrafting were embedded in Indigenous and mestizo agroforestry systems, with garden plots and forest fallows managed for ritual and medicinal supply [5][6].

Urban ayahuasca circles, by contrast, manifest in metropolitan and peri-urban venues across South American capitals, North American cities, and European urban centers, facilitated by transnational networks of practitioners, retreat centers, and religious organizations [1][7]. This expansion accompanies both the global mobility of ceremonial leaders and the emergence of local facilitators trained through apprenticeships, church-based structures, or hybrid programs [1][7]. The spatial dislocation between plant habitats and urban consumption has intensified logistical challenges—sourcing, transport, quality control, and legality—while also catalyzing new cultivation initiatives outside Amazonia and in Amazonian peri-urban fringes to meet growing demand [1][4][7].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Within Amazonian Indigenous groups such as the Shipibo-Conibo, Shuar, Siona, and Tukano, ayahuasca has long functioned as a sacred medicine integral to communal healing, divination, and rites of passage [2][5]. The twentieth century saw the formalization of syncretic religious movements—Santo Daime, União do Vegetal, Barquinha—that integrated Christian, Afro-Brazilian, and Indigenous elements into ceremonial frameworks, subsequently spreading beyond Brazil and shaping global perceptions of the brew [7]. Urban ayahuasca circles arise against this backdrop, translating ritual motifs, songs (icaros), diets, and cosmologies into city-based practices oriented toward spiritual insight, therapeutic growth, and community support [1][7][2].

Participant demographics in urban contexts are diverse, encompassing spiritual seekers, individuals addressing trauma or mental health challenges, and those drawn by intercultural curiosity or personal development aims [1][7]. Facilitators include Amazonian-trained curanderos and shamans, mestizo vegetalistas, neo-shamanic Western practitioners, and leaders from syncretic churches, often working collaboratively or in rotating constellations [1][2][7]. Some circles strive to carefully replicate Amazonian formats—night ceremonies, specific seating orders, dietary restrictions, tobacco and perfume use, and the centrality of icaros—while others hybridize practices through yoga, guided meditation, breathwork, and psychotherapeutic group processes [3][1]. These adaptations reflect urban participants’ biographies and expectations, as well as venue constraints and legal considerations, typically leading to shorter ceremonies, smaller groups, and a pronounced emphasis on pre- and post-ceremony framing [1][7].

Symbolically, ayahuasca retains its identity as a teacher plant, though personifications and interpretive frameworks vary. The brew may be experienced as a maternal presence, a forest intelligence, or a catalyst for introspection; urban narratives frequently reframe its action as a tool for self-exploration, trauma processing, and existential inquiry [3][1][2]. This semiotic plasticity facilitates cross-cultural translation while also prompting debates over the preservation of lineage-specific meanings and the risks of decontextualization [1][2][7].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
The psychoactive action of ayahuasca is classically explained by the synergistic interaction between β-carbolines in [[Banisteriopsis caapi]]—harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine—which inhibit monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) from [[Psychotria viridis]] or [[Diplopterys cabrerana]] [6][5]. Inhibition of MAO-A permits oral DMT activity by preventing rapid metabolic deactivation, while tetrahydroharmine also exhibits serotonin reuptake inhibition, potentially contributing to the brew’s qualitative profile [6][5]. Acute effects commonly include alterations in perception and affect, purgative responses, and complex visionary phenomena. Longitudinal reports and observational studies suggest possible impacts on mood regulation, meaning-making, and behavioral change, though mechanisms are incompletely understood and mediated by set, setting, and ritual framing [5][7].

In symbolic registers, the pharmacological synergy is enfolded within cosmologies that interpret visions as relational encounters with spirits, plant teachers, or the moral ecology of the forest. Urban circles often translate these experiences into psychological idioms—shadow work, somatic release, and integration of autobiographical memory—while maintaining ritual engines of sound and intention (icaros, hymns, drumming) to guide and structure experiential flow [3][1][2]. This semiotic flexibility contributes to ayahuasca’s global uptake, while simultaneously inviting caution about overgeneralizing biomedical or spiritual claims across disparate cultural frames [7].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Traditional preparation typically involves macerating sections of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] vine and brewing them with leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]] or [[Diplopterys cabrerana]] over many hours or days, accompanied by prayers, songs, and ritual observances that acknowledge plant spirits and lineage protocols [6][5]. The resulting decoction is served in nocturnal ceremonies led by a knowledgeable facilitator, with dietary and behavioral restrictions observed before and after the event to cultivate receptivity and safety [5][6].

In urban settings, the beverage is frequently sourced from Amazonia via Indigenous and mestizo suppliers or church-affiliated networks, introducing variability in composition, potency, and quality, as well as ethical and sustainability concerns tied to procurement and transport [1][4]. Urban circles often include:
- Pre-ceremony orientations and screening conversations to set expectations and assess readiness [2][1].
- Ritual cleansing and protection practices (smoke, scent, prayer), invocation of guardians, and the singing of icaros or equivalent sacred songs to guide the process [2].
- Adaptations to space and time: mats or chairs arranged in a circle, shorter ceremonies, and smaller groups than typical community-based events [1].
- Modified dietary guidance, sometimes abbreviated relative to strict traditional diets [1][7].
- Post-ceremony integration sessions—group sharing, counseling, or somatic practices—to contextualize insights and support behavioral change in daily life [3][8].

These procedural elements reflect a deliberate accommodation to urban participants’ schedules, therapeutic aims, and risk management concerns while attempting to preserve key ritual features associated with safety and efficacy [1][7][3]. The prominence of integration—rarely formalized in many traditional settings—has become a defining hallmark of urban circles, fostering communities of practice that extend beyond the ceremony itself [3][8].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
The globalization and commodification of ayahuasca present intertwined ecological, cultural, and legal challenges:

- Sustainability and supply chains
  - Intensifying demand can pressure natural populations of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and DMT-admixture plants, particularly when harvesting follows short rotation cycles or unsustainable extraction [1][4]. Ethical responses include community-based cultivation, transparent sourcing, fair compensation, and investment in local nurseries and agroforestry systems that align supply with regeneration [1][4][7].
  - Quality control in transnational circuits is inconsistent; contamination and adulteration risks underscore the importance of traceability and relational accountability between facilitators and suppliers [1][4].

- Biocultural rights and cultural continuity
  - As practices migrate into urban and international contexts, concerns arise over cultural appropriation, dilution of lineage knowledge, and erasure of Indigenous intellectual property [1][2]. Ethical guidelines encourage honoring Indigenous custodianship, supporting Amazonian communities economically and culturally, and ensuring facilitator training is verifiable and grounded in accountable mentorship [1][2].
  - Documentation and preservation of ceremonial protocols coexist with legitimate local adaptations, generating both revitalization and disputes over authenticity. Dialogue across traditions and co-created standards can help navigate this tension [1][2][7].

- Safety, screening, and care
  - Urban circles increasingly formalize participant screening and integration to respond to heterogeneous health backgrounds and expectations, while maintaining respect for ritual efficacy and autonomy [3][8]. Without legal recognition or regulation in some jurisdictions, communities often self-organize harm-reduction norms and peer accountability structures [7][2].

- Legal status and religious freedom
  - Because DMT is controlled in many countries, ayahuasca’s legal status ranges from prohibition to conditional exemptions for recognized religious organizations. This ambiguity affects participant safety, the visibility of circles, and the ability of facilitators to operate openly [2]. Notable exceptions include certain South American countries and specific European contexts where regulated practice or religious accommodation exists; elsewhere, legal risk shapes how and where ceremonies occur [2][7].

Addressing these considerations requires integrating ecological stewardship with biocultural justice: recognizing the forest origins of the brew, the sovereignty of knowledge-holding communities, and the responsibilities of urban practitioners and participants within transnational networks [1][7][4][2].
