## Abstract
The Matsés Frog Ritual centers on the application of the cutaneous secretion of Phyllomedusa bicolor, widely known as Kambo (kambô in Portuguese; acaté in Matsés; sapo in Amazonian Spanish). Within Matsés lifeworlds, the ritual is undertaken to sharpen hunting capacity, fortify resilience in the forest, and effect a thorough bodily and spiritual cleansing. The practice crystallizes longstanding relationships between people, animals, and place, while circulating knowledge of therapeutic power through apprenticeship and ceremonial stewardship. This article synthesizes zoological background, geographic distribution, ethnographic context, ceremonial practice, peptide pharmacology, and contemporary issues of sustainability and biocultural rights, drawing on ethnobotanical and anthropological sources and published overviews (Acate Amazon Conservation 2022 [https://acateamazon.org/acate/]; Xapiri Ground 2022 [https://www.xapiriground.org/design-heritage/matses-medicine]; Amazon Explorer 2023 [https://amazonexplorer.com/culture-of-indigenous-matses-people-the-frog-medicine-kambo/]; ClinMed Journals 2017 [https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijpp/international-journal-of-psychology-and-psychoanalysis-ijpp-4-034.php?jid=ijpp]; OJPM 2016 [https://www.clinsurggroup.us/articles/OJPM-2-107.php]; Wikipedia 2025 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kambo_(drug)]). It concludes with notes on continuity, intercultural transmission, and safeguards for ethical practice.

## Botanical Classification
Taxonomic placement (zoological) of the species whose secretion is central to the ritual:

- Kingdom: Animalia  
- Phylum: Chordata  
- Class: Amphibia  
- Order: Anura  
- Family: Phyllomedusinae (within Hylidae)  
- Genus: Phyllomedusa  
- Species: Phyllomedusa bicolor (commonly: giant monkey frog)

Common names include kambô (Brazilian Portuguese), acaté (Matsés), and sapo (local Spanish). The ritual practice is focused on collecting and applying the frog’s skin secretion, rather than on plant material, placing it at the intersection of ethnobotany and ethnozoology (Acate Amazon Conservation 2022 [https://acateamazon.org/acate/]; Wikipedia 2025 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kambo_(drug)]). Within Amazonian medical-ritual repertoires, Kambo is sometimes placed in dialogue with plant teacher ceremonies such as ayahuasca brewed from [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and companion admixtures like [[Psychotria viridis]], although it is not visionary and follows distinct ceremonial protocols in Matsés practice.

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Phyllomedusa bicolor is a large arboreal frog distributed broadly across lowland Amazonian forests, with confirmed occurrence in eastern Peru and western to northern Brazil, and in adjacent regions of the upper Amazon Basin (Acate Amazon Conservation 2022 [https://acateamazon.org/acate/]; Wikipedia 2025 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kambo_(drug)]). The species is typically associated with:

- Terra firme and seasonally flooded forest mosaics, often near slow-moving waters and oxbow lakes.
- Arboreal microhabitats; individuals roost on broad leaves and branches, descending or calling during rainy and humid periods.
- Reproductive behavior aligned with rainy-season hydrology; like other Phyllomedusa, pairs deposit egg masses on leaves overhanging water, with larvae dropping into aquatic habitats after hatching.

For Matsés communities living along forest rivers and interfluvial zones, the frog’s calls during the wet season aid tracking by specialists, facilitating respectful capture and release associated with harvesting the secretion (Amazon Explorer 2023 [https://amazonexplorer.com/culture-of-indigenous-matses-people-the-frog-medicine-kambo/]; Xapiri Ground 2022 [https://www.xapiriground.org/design-heritage/matses-medicine]).

## Ethnobotanical Context
Among the Matsés, Kambo belongs to a suite of ritual-therapeutic practices that explicitly align human bodies with the powers of the forest. It is particularly associated with hunting success, physical vigor, and resistance to environmental hardship.

- Traditional use and ritual setting: The secretion is administered during structured ceremonies, often led by experienced male specialists. Sessions may coincide with the rainy season or periods of subsistence stress, when improved stamina and sensory acuity are prized (Amazon Explorer 2023 [https://amazonexplorer.com/culture-of-indigenous-matses-people-the-frog-medicine-kambo/]; Xapiri Ground 2022 [https://www.xapiriground.org/design-heritage/matses-medicine]). Transient but intense physiological responses—facial flushing, warmth, vomiting, sweating, tachycardia, and malaise—are interpreted as the body’s purgation of mala suerte (“bad luck”), pathogenic influences, and fatigue. The state that follows is described as lightness, sharpened senses, and resilient calm that supports extended hunting treks.

- Mythic and moral dimensions: Elder accounts situate Kambo’s adoption within intergroup exchange, including borrowing from neighboring groups (e.g., the Camumbos), situating the secretion as a gift mediated by forest sociality rather than a singular tribal discovery (Xapiri Ground 2022 [https://www.xapiriground.org/design-heritage/matses-medicine]). The frog is understood as protector and mediator, a being whose bodily qualities—toughness, weather-resistance, and alertness—can be ritually acquired (Acate Amazon Conservation 2022 [https://acateamazon.org/acate/]).

- Transmission and gender: While historically a male-centered hunting medicine, instruction is transmitted within kin networks through apprenticeship: observing capture protocols, learning the songs and cadence of application, and reading bodily signs during and after administration (Xapiri Ground 2022 [https://www.xapiriground.org/design-heritage/matses-medicine]). The pedagogy consolidates group cohesion and languages of care, with seasoned hunters sometimes administering Kambo to younger or less successful peers in lean times.

- Contemporary expansion: In the last three decades, Kambo has traveled into urban Brazil and beyond, appearing in global wellness circuits and alternative medicine scenes. This expansion has stimulated both interest in the secretion’s bioactivity and concern regarding cultural expropriation, standardization detached from context, and uneven benefit flows to source communities (ClinMed Journals 2017 [https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijpp/international-journal-of-psychology-and-psychoanalysis-ijpp-4-034.php?jid=ijpp]).

In contrast to visionary plant teacher ceremonies like those organized around [[Banisteriopsis caapi]], Matsés Kambo is not pursued for visions but for somatic realignment; its efficacy is narrated less through insight than through performance—greater endurance, successful tracking, and bodily robustness.

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Kambo secretion is rich in bioactive peptides with high potency and diverse physiological effects. Reported constituents include phyllocaerulein, phyllomedusin, phyllokinin, sauvagine, dermaseptin B2, adenoregulin, deltorphins, and dermorphin (ClinMed Journals 2017 [https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijpp/international-journal-of-psychology-and-psychoanalysis-ijpp-4-034.php?jid=ijpp]; OJPM 2016 [https://www.clinsurggroup.us/articles/OJPM-2-107.php]).

- Deltorphins and dermorphin: Among the most potent natural opioid agonists known, acting with high affinity at delta and mu opioid receptors, respectively. Their activity is implicated in rapid-onset flushing, analgesia, and shifts in autonomic tone, but the crude secretion’s overall effect reflects synergistic peptide actions rather than isolated opioidergic signaling (ClinMed Journals 2017 [https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijpp/international-journal-of-psychology-and-psychoanalysis-ijpp-4-034.php?jid=ijpp]).

- Phyllomedusin and related tachykinins: Promote smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretion, and vasodilation, contributing to gastrointestinal motility and the emetic purge characteristic of the ritual response (OJPM 2016 [https://www.clinsurggroup.us/articles/OJPM-2-107.php]).

- Phyllokinin and kinins: Bradykinin-like peptides inducing vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, aligning with transient hypotension, warmth, and edema.

- Sauvagine (CRF-like peptide): Engages stress-response axes, influencing cardiovascular parameters and diuresis.

- Dermaseptins and related antimicrobial peptides: Display broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro, adding a plausible rationale for the secretion’s protective associations in humid forest environments where minor skin breaches and infections are common (OJPM 2016 [https://www.clinsurggroup.us/articles/OJPM-2-107.php]).

- Adenoregulin: Implicated in modulation of adenosine receptor systems, with proposed neuroactive and cardioregulatory effects.

The composite pharmacological response typically features a rapid onset (seconds to minutes) after transdermal application, with acute effects resolving within 20–60 minutes. Reported physiological phenomena include facial flushing, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lacrimation, and sweating; subjective reports describe a difficult but brief storm followed by clarity, stamina, and an absence of rumination, which Matsés hunters value as “clean” focus.

Safety considerations: Unsupervised administration and detached-from-context practices have been associated with adverse events, including severe dehydration, loss of consciousness, and rare fatalities; allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are possible (Wikipedia 2025 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kambo_(drug)]; ClinMed Journals 2017 [https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijpp/international-journal-of-psychology-and-psychoanalysis-ijpp-4-034.php?jid=ijpp]). These risks underscore the emphasis within Matsés practice on experienced leadership, careful attention to bodily signs, and adherence to ritual protocols.

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Matsés ceremonial logistics are oriented toward respectful engagement with the frog, careful handling of the secretion, and a highly interpersonal pedagogy of administration.

- Frog encounter and collection: Practitioners locate Phyllomedusa bicolor by call and habitat knowledge, typically during wet, humid periods. Capture is performed gently and deliberately to avoid injury (Amazon Explorer 2023 [https://amazonexplorer.com/culture-of-indigenous-matses-people-the-frog-medicine-kambo/]).

- Secretion harvesting: The frog is fixed on a pliant frame of woven fibers. Mild stimulation induces exudation of a milky secretion from dorsal glands, which is carefully scraped onto a small wooden spatula or stick. The secretion is dried for storage and safekeeping before eventual rehydration for application. The animal is then released, reflecting an ethic of non-lethal reciprocity (Xapiri Ground 2022 [https://www.xapiriground.org/design-heritage/matses-medicine]; Amazon Explorer 2023 [https://amazonexplorer.com/culture-of-indigenous-matses-people-the-frog-medicine-kambo/]).

- Administration: Prior to application, dried secretion is rehydrated to a workable paste. Using a heated vine (e.g., tamshi), the practitioner makes a series of small, superficial burns on the recipient’s arm, leg, or chest; the epidermal layer is lightly removed at these points, and the secretion is placed directly onto each “point,” facilitating rapid uptake via the lymphatic circulation (Amazon Explorer 2023 [https://amazonexplorer.com/culture-of-indigenous-matses-people-the-frog-medicine-kambo/]; Wikipedia 2025 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kambo_(drug)]). The number and distribution of points are adapted to context, prior experience, and perceived need.

- Ritual accompaniment: Ceremonies are often scheduled on rainy days and may include chanting or song. The administering expert monitors pulse, coloration, and behavioral signs, guiding the recipient through the purge and ensuring rest, hydration, and post-ritual grounding. Immediate effects—nausea, emesis, sweating, lightheadedness—are reframed as cleansing crises that remove “panema” (bad luck, torpor) and align the body with forest vitality (Mountains of Hope 2022 [https://www.mountainsofhope.com/blog/kambo-the-healing-frog-medicine-of-the-amazon-rainforest]; Amazon Explorer 2023 [https://amazonexplorer.com/culture-of-indigenous-matses-people-the-frog-medicine-kambo/]).

- Social and pedagogical dimensions: Knowledge transmission is not limited to “technique”; it includes instruction on respectful frog handling, recognition of appropriate times for ritual use, and cultivation of character—patience, courage, and attentiveness. In periods of poor hunting returns, seasoned hunters may recommend or apply Kambo to younger hunters to restore vigor and confidence, reinforcing intergenerational bonds (Xapiri Ground 2022 [https://www.xapiriground.org/design-heritage/matses-medicine]).

While contemporary global Kambo sessions may adopt elements of this protocol, the Matsés ritual’s meanings and safeguards are strongly embedded in local cosmology, environmental fluency, and the moral authority of those who steward the practice.

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
The Kambo ritual is inseparable from the forest ecologies that sustain both people and frog populations. As the practice circulates widely, questions of sustainability, safety, and justice come to the fore.

- Sustainability and animal welfare: Matsés protocols emphasize non-lethal harvest and prompt release of healthy frogs at the point of capture. This approach is consistent with long-term coexistence and reflects a biocultural stewardship ethic (Amazon Explorer 2023 [https://amazonexplorer.com/culture-of-indigenous-matses-people-the-frog-medicine-kambo/]). Increases in commercial demand outside Indigenous territories raise concerns about potential overharvesting, improper handling, and stress to local populations when protocols are not followed.

- Biocultural rights and benefit-sharing: The diffusion of Kambo into global wellness markets and research settings has prompted debate over biopiracy, appropriation of Indigenous knowledge, and the equitable sharing of benefits derived from traditional medicines. Matsés voices and allied organizations have called for explicit recognition of traditional ownership, culturally grounded informed consent, and mechanisms that return tangible benefits to source communities (ClinMed Journals 2017 [https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijpp/international-journal-of-psychology-and-psychoanalysis-ijpp-4-034.php?jid=ijpp]; Acate Amazon Conservation 2022 [https://acateamazon.org/acate/]).

- Cultural respect and safety: Medical risks—including severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, anaphylaxis, and rare fatalities—underscore the importance of context-sensitive administration by trained practitioners, along with careful screening and monitoring (Wikipedia 2025 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kambo_(drug)]; ClinMed Journals 2017 [https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijpp/international-journal-of-psychology-and-psychoanalysis-ijpp-4-034.php?jid=ijpp]). Cultural respect entails more than invoking Indigenous origins; it requires deference to community-defined protocols, acknowledgment of ritual leadership, and avoidance of reductive “biohacking” framings that detach Kambo from the social and ecological relations that give it meaning.

- Continuity and community-led documentation: Matsés community initiatives—often in partnership with organizations such as Acaté—support the documentation of language, medicinal knowledge, and ritual practices in culturally controlled formats, aiming to preserve and renew Kambo knowledge for future generations under community governance (Acate Amazon Conservation 2022 [https://acateamazon.org/acate/]).

Ethical engagement with Kambo therefore combines ecological prudence, legal and moral recognition of Indigenous sovereignty over knowledge, and pragmatic safeguards to minimize harm in any intercultural setting where the secretion is applied.
