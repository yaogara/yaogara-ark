## Abstract
Kambo—also known as sapo or vacina-do-sapo—is a potent defensive secretion obtained from the Amazonian giant tree frog, Phyllomedusa bicolor. Within Indigenous ritual systems of the Western Amazon, the application of kambo is framed as a purification and fortification practice intended to purge illness, misfortune, or “negative energies,” and to restore well-being and hunting acuity. Over the past three decades, the practice has circulated far beyond its traditional settings into urban South America and international wellness markets, where it is variably ritualized, secularized, or commercialized. Scientific interest centers on kambo’s complex mixture of bioactive peptides and their pharmacological actions on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, and nervous systems, alongside antimicrobial peptides of ecological significance. This expanding ethnopharmacological and cultural footprint has intensified questions surrounding medical risks, evidence standards, intellectual property, and stewardship of Indigenous knowledge and biocultural resources [(Erspamer et al. 1985)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.997318/full) [(Toledo et al. 2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582952/).

## Botanical Classification
Although popularly grouped among “teacher plants,” kambo is a secretion of an amphibian. The following classification pertains to the source organism.

- Kingdom: Animalia
- Phylum: Chordata
- Class: Amphibia
- Order: Anura
- Family: Phyllomedusidae
- Genus: Phyllomedusa
- Species: Phyllomedusa bicolor

Common names for the secretion include “kambo,” “sapo,” and “vacina-do-sapo,” reflecting regional Portuguese and Indigenous usage across the Western Amazon [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kambo_(drug)). In contemporary discourse, it is often discussed alongside other ritual medicines such as [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and admixtures like [[Psychotria viridis]], though kambo is neither botanical nor entheogenic in the conventional sense.

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Phyllomedusa bicolor inhabits lowland rainforests across the Amazon basin, with occurrences documented in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and parts of Bolivia. The species is primarily arboreal, nocturnal, and emblematic of the humid canopy microhabitats that support leaf-breeding amphibians. Its bright green coloration, robust body size, and characteristic vocalizations facilitate its identification by experienced local specialists [(Frontiers in Pharmacology 2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.997318/full).

The frog’s cutaneous glands produce a viscous secretion as a defense against predators and pathogens. Ethnographic and ecological accounts note that secretion output is influenced by stress and handling, though established Indigenous techniques seek to minimize harm and allow for release of the frog post-collection [(Nature 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78527-4). This ecological–behavioral interface has become increasingly salient as demand for kambo grows beyond the rainforest, prompting scrutiny of harvest pressures and husbandry practices in both forest and peri-urban supply chains [(Nature 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78527-4).

## Ethnobotanical Context
Kambo practice is attested among Panoan-speaking and other Indigenous groups of Western Amazonia, including the Matsés (Peru/Brazil), Katukina, Mayoruna, Marubo, and Yawanawá (Brazil), and has diffused into regional mestizo communities [(Nature 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78527-4). Within these traditions, kambo is framed as a purification rite intended to eliminate illnesses, malign influences, or misfortune, and to reorient embodied capacities for hunting and daily labor. As such, it participates in a broader Amazonian pharmacopeia that integrates animal- and plant-derived medicines into complex systems of relational health, ritual expertise, and cosmology [(Frontiers in Pharmacology 2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.997318/full) [(NIH 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11833272/).

Practitioners contextualize the acute physiological crisis induced by kambo—vasodilation, profuse sweating, emesis, and other cathartic processes—as a ritual cleansing that expels pathogenic, dietary, or spiritual impurities. In some hunting contexts, the rite is performed to dispel panema (bad luck) and to sharpen perception in the forest. The therapeutic and pragmatic dimensions are typically inseparable from social and moral frameworks—purity, courage, intention, and kinship—mediated by specialists who determine suitability and timing for recipients [(Nature 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78527-4).

Since the late twentieth century, kambo has proliferated in urban centers within and beyond South America, where it may be framed as detoxification, immune “reset,” or wellness intervention. In these settings, the ritual ranges from community-oriented ceremonies led by experienced facilitators to highly individualized, commercialized services. This diversification brings heterogeneity in dose-setting, screening, hydration practices, and aftercare, contributing to variable safety profiles and outcomes [(Better Health Channel)](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/Kambo). Indigenous leaders and allied organizations have voiced concerns over appropriation, dilution of ritual safeguards, and the bypassing of extended apprenticeship models that traditionally regulate the practice [(Frontiers in Pharmacology 2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.997318/full).

In contrast to visionary or entheogenic ceremonies centered on [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] or admixtures of [[Psychotria viridis]], kambo is not ordinarily pursued for visions. Its primary aims are purgative, protective, and strengthening, even as some recipients report transient shifts in mood, clarity, or embodied awareness during recovery phases [(PMC 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582952/).

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Kambo is a complex cocktail of bioactive peptides that act across multiple physiological systems. Prominent constituents reported in the literature include:

- Phyllocaerulein, a caerulein-like peptide with hypotensive and gastrointestinal effects.
- Phyllomedusin and phyllokinin, tachykinin- and bradykinin-like peptides associated with vasodilation and smooth muscle activity.
- Dermorphins and deltorphins, high-affinity opioid peptides with selectivity for μ- and δ-opioid receptors.
- Sauvagine, a corticotropin-releasing factor-like peptide influencing cardiovascular and stress-axis parameters.
- Adenoregulin, implicated in modulation of adenosine receptor-related physiology.
- Dermaseptins and related antimicrobial peptides with broad bactericidal and fungicidal activity [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kambo_(drug)) [(NIH 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11833272/).

When applied to superficial skin lesions, peptides rapidly enter systemic circulation, precipitating an acute response. Reported effects include abrupt flushing, hypotension or blood pressure fluctuations, tachycardia, lacrimation, sialorrhea, intense nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and facial edema. These peak within minutes and generally subside within 15–40 minutes, followed by fatigue and, for some, a period of perceived clarity or calm. The broad physiological footprint reflects the diversity of receptor interactions (kinin, tachykinin, opioid, adrenergic, and CRF-related pathways) and peripheral targets (vascular endothelium, gastrointestinal smooth muscle, and immune interfaces). The antimicrobial dermaseptins, central to the frog’s ecological defense, have attracted pharmacological interest for their potential anti-infective properties in vitro [(PMC 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582952/).

Despite preliminary biochemical characterizations, controlled clinical evidence for safety or efficacy in human therapeutic indications remains limited. Adverse events have been documented, ranging from transient hypotension and dehydration to hyponatremia, seizures, biliary or pancreatic irritation, and rare fatal outcomes, particularly when protocols diverge from traditional safeguards or when contraindications (e.g., certain cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, or psychiatric conditions; drug interactions; electrolyte disturbances) are not screened. Variability in preparation, hydration practices, and dose-setting in non-traditional contexts further complicates risk profiles [(NIH 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11833272/) [(Better Health Channel)](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/Kambo).

In symbolic terms, the pharmacological crisis is interpreted as a ritual purge that physically and spiritually “clears” the body, a reading that coexists with biomedical perspectives emphasizing stress-axis activation, opioid receptor engagement, and fluid-electrolyte dynamics. Ethnophysiological and laboratory narratives thus overlap and diverge, underscoring the need for transdisciplinary approaches that respect cultural meanings while rigorously evaluating safety and effectiveness [(Nature 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78527-4) [(NIH 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11833272/).

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Ethnographic accounts describe a patterned sequence of sourcing, preparation, application, and recovery governed by specialists and social norms. The following elements are characteristic in documented settings; descriptions are provided for context rather than instruction.

- Sourcing and harvest: Experienced individuals locate P. bicolor by call, often after rains when frogs are active. Following local ethical codes emphasizing reciprocity and non-injury, the frog may be gently restrained while secretions are collected by lightly scraping the dorsal skin with a spatula or stick. The frog is typically released, and practices are oriented to avoid lasting harm [(Nature 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78527-4).

- Preparing the secretion: The viscous exudate is spread onto a flat wooden stick or similar surface and allowed to dry for storage. Properly stored, the material is considered active for months. Prior to use, a small amount is moistened for application.

- Application setting and technique: Ritual specialists determine the suitability, timing, and amount to be used. Small superficial burns or dots are created to remove the outer epidermis and permit rapid transdermal absorption; placement varies by custom (e.g., upper arm, lower leg), and is culturally gendered in some traditions [(NIH 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11833272/). The moistened secretion is placed onto these points.

- Acute phase and aftercare: Within minutes, recipients commonly experience flushing, tachycardia, profuse perspiration, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and transient swelling. The acute phase is brief, often 15–40 minutes, after which rest is encouraged. In some traditions, salt water or manioc beverage is consumed around the rite to assist purging and recovery [(NIH 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11833272/).

- Social and ceremonial elements: The rite is frequently embedded in group settings and may include song, incense, and collective participation. The specialist monitors recipients, adjusts the number and placement of application points, and manages timing. Responsibility for screening, supervision, and safety is vested in the ritual authority, whose apprenticeship and social role legitimize practice in community contexts [(Frontiers in Pharmacology 2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.997318/full).

Beyond Indigenous contexts, contemporary practitioners adopt diverse methods. Some endeavor to retain ceremonial forms and community safeguards; others offer highly individualized or commercialized services with variable screening, hydration protocols, and follow-up. Public health advisories in several jurisdictions underscore that medical risks can be significant, especially without trained supervision or when combined with other substances or practices [(Better Health Channel)](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/Kambo).

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
- Ecological status and sustainability: Phyllomedusa bicolor is not currently listed as endangered. However, the long-term sustainability of intensified, commercial harvest remains uncertain, given habitat loss in parts of the Amazon and potential local pressures from market demand. Ethical sourcing frameworks increasingly emphasize minimal handling, non-lethal collection, and release, alongside community-based monitoring of frog populations [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kambo_(drug)) [(Nature 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78527-4).

- Biocultural rights and benefit sharing: Kambo is embedded in Indigenous knowledge systems and ritual economies. Ethical practice entails respect for Indigenous biocultural rights, including informed consent for knowledge use, acknowledgment of origin, and equitable benefit sharing where commercial transactions occur. Debates continue over intellectual property claims on peptides and protocols, with calls for collaborative governance that centers Indigenous authority and safeguards ritual integrity [(Frontiers in Pharmacology 2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.997318/full).

- Safety, regulation, and public health: Documented adverse events—ranging from acute cardiovascular and electrolyte disturbances to rare fatalities—highlight the need for robust screening, supervision, and aftercare. Regulatory responses vary widely, from absence of formal oversight to explicit warnings by health agencies. Prospective recipients are cautioned that contraindications may be numerous, and that practices outside trained supervision substantially increase risk [(NIH 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11833272/) [(Better Health Channel)](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/Kambo).

- Research priorities: Future work should rigorously assess efficacy claims for specific indications, delineate risk factors, and characterize variability in peptide profiles across populations and storage conditions. Equally vital are community-led studies on sustainable harvest, local governance of ritual practice, and models of benefit sharing that align biomedical research with Indigenous priorities [(PMC 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582952/).
