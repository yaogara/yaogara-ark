## Abstract
Copal and associated Amazonian incense traditions represent a complex system of botanical knowledge, ritual practice, and cultural symbolism throughout Amazonia and Mesoamerica. Used for prayer, offerings, and ceremonial purification, resins such as copal (Protium spp.; Bursera spp.) and woods including palo santo (Bursera graveolens) play critical roles in facilitating communication with ancestors and spiritual entities, demarcating sacred space, and supporting healing lineages. These incense practices, adapted across Indigenous, mestizo, and mestizo-Christian groups, continue to be central to ritual life from southern Mexico to the Andes, raising urgent questions of conservation and biocultural rights (1)(2)(3)(7).

## Botanical Classification
The term “copal” encompasses a set of hard, aromatic resins sourced from multiple members of the frankincense–myrrh family Burseraceae. While the vernacular category is broad, ethnobotanical discourse commonly distinguishes between Mesoamerican “true copals” derived from Bursera species and Amazonian/local equivalents derived from Protium species (1).

- Family: Burseraceae (1)  
- Representative genera and species:  
  - Bursera: including Bursera bipinnata (a principal Mesoamerican copal), Bursera graveolens (palo santo; aromatic wood and oleoresin) (1)(2)  
  - Protium: a widespread Amazonian genus yielding resins known regionally as copal blanco or breu branco; representative species frequently cited in commerce and local practice include Protium spp. used for “Amazonian white copal” (1)(7)

Copal in the Mesoamerican sense is particularly associated with Bursera bipinnata and related taxa, whose hardened exudates have been ritually burned from pre-Hispanic times through the present (1)(2). In the western Amazon and adjoining areas, Protium resins function analogously in ritual fumigation and offerings, with the Portuguese vernacular “breu branco” widely used in Brazil (1)(7). Palo santo, Bursera graveolens, is a closely related Andean–coastal species providing fragrant heartwood and resin that are burned in comparable ceremonial contexts (1).

Because “copal” does not refer to a single taxon, its classification is best understood as a cultural–functional category encompassing chemically similar terpenoid resins from several species within Burseraceae, locally selected for aroma, combustibility, and perceived spiritual efficacy (1)(4).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Burseraceae are distributed across tropical lowland and seasonally dry forests from southern Mexico to northern Argentina, with the greatest ritual documentation of copal in Mesoamerica (e.g., Mexico and Guatemala) and significant ritual/medicinal use of Protium resins throughout the Amazon Basin (1)(7).

- Mesoamerica: Bursera species (including B. bipinnata) occupy seasonally dry tropical forests and thornscrub from central and southern Mexico into Central America. Traditional collecting zones and markets for copal extend from highland communities to coastal regions, with long-standing ritual economies supplying temples, household altars, and festivals (1)(2)(3).
- Amazonia and adjacent regions: Protium species are abundant in terra firme forests, varzea edges, and transitional habitats. In Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador, Protium resins—sold as copal blanco or breu branco—are gathered from wild trees in lowland forests and foothill ecotones (1)(7). 
- Andes and Pacific dry forests: Bursera graveolens (palo santo) inhabits seasonally dry tropical forests along the Pacific slopes and coastal regions of Ecuador, Peru, and parts of northern South America; aromatic sticks and oil are produced from naturally fallen wood and, in some cases, from managed harvests (1).

These distributions underpin regional specializations in incense practice: Mesoamerican copals center on Bursera resins, while Amazonian copals (and many commercial “white copals”) derive primarily from Protium (1)(7).

## Ethnobotanical Context
The ritual burning of copal—copaltemaliztl in Nahuatl—is a deeply rooted practice spanning Indigenous, mestizo, and syncretic communities in Mesoamerica and Amazonia (2)(3)(1). Its smoke serves as a visible prayer, an offering, a purifying force, and a boundary marker that differentiates secular from sacred space.

- Mesoamerican lineages: Archaeological, ethnohistoric, and ethnographic records describe copal’s centrality in offerings among Mexica (Aztec), Maya, Otomi, and many other groups. The ascending smoke is a vehicle for petitions and gratitude to deities and ancestors, notably during Dia de los Muertos, agricultural rites, healings, and divination. Contemporary celebrations continue to feature copal on home and communal altars, at gravesites, and in pilgrimages (2)(3)(1)(8)(9)(10).
- Amazonian and Andean practice: In the Amazon and Andes, copal and palo santo are similarly used to cleanse ceremonial spaces, protect participants, and feed or propitiate non-human persons, including Earth Mother (Pachamama) and mountain spirits (apus). In Shipibo, Quechua, and mestizo [[Ayahuasca]] traditions, incense smoke is used to “rationalize the air” (ordenar el aire), ward off malevolent influences, and invite allied beings; it often accompanies icaros, prayers, and the administration of plant medicines (1). In many malocas and ceremonial houses, smoke offerings bracket the opening and closing of sessions centered on [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and companion plants such as [[Psychotria viridis]], reinforcing protection and intentionality (1).

Syncretism and continuity. Following colonial transformations, copal usage folded into Catholic liturgies where frankincense was unavailable or replaced with “local holy incense,” yielding hybrid modalities that persist today in churches, processions, and household devotions (1)(2). This continuity is underwritten by intergenerational teaching, ritual apprenticeship, and the public renewal of practice during major festivals—Dia de los Muertos being the emblematic case, now recognized in cultural heritage frameworks that help sustain transmission (3).

Knowledge transmission remains chiefly oral, passed through curanderos, shamans, midwives, and family elders. Urban migrations and revitalization movements have catalyzed renewed engagement by younger practitioners, alongside New Age adaptations that expand reach while sometimes diluting cultural specificity (1)(2)(3).

Symbolic dimensions. Across languages, the terms for copal evoke offering, nourishment, and relational reciprocity—“food for the gods”—with smoke as a messenger bridging human–spirit worlds. The aromatic column delineates sacred boundaries, transforms states of being (from impure to pure, profane to sacred), and inscribes relations of respect and obligation among persons, places, and powers (2)(4).

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Copal resins consist predominantly of terpenoid compounds whose volatile fractions drive aroma and whose resin acids and triterpenes contribute to physical properties such as hardness and burn profile. While composition varies by species and geography, commonly reported constituents include alpha- and beta-pinene, limonene, and a suite of higher terpenes and triterpenoids (1).

- Aromatic and antimicrobial properties: The monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes present in copal are responsible for its fresh, balsamic, and citrus-pine fragrance. Ethnopharmacological accounts attribute antibacterial and antifungal effects to certain resin fractions, aligning with broader observations of terpenoid bioactivity in plant exudates (1). This supports traditional topical use for minor wounds and skin disorders, although systematic clinical evidence remains limited (1).
- Topical and ritual uses: In several regions, softened resin is applied to small cuts, insect bites, or sore joints; poultices or resin-infused oils are sometimes prepared for localized complaints. Internal use is less common, and inhalational exposure is primarily ritual—deliberately mediated through fumigation rather than direct ingestion (1).
- Psycho-olfactory and symbolic action: The perceived “clearing,” “ordering,” or “protection” afforded by copal smoke in ritual contexts can be understood as an interaction of olfactory signaling, cultural interpretation, and place-making. The fragrance anchors attention, synchronizes group activity, and marks liminal transitions, complementing singing, prayer, and the administration of visionary plants in ceremonies such as [[Ayahuasca]] (1)(2).

Given the heterogeneity of sources labeled “copal,” chemical and pharmacological profiles should be interpreted as genus- and even species-specific, with local names (e.g., copal blanco, breu branco) signaling particular olfactory and functional expectations (1)(4)(7).

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Harvest and handling. Copal resin is obtained by tapping or by collecting hardened exudates from natural fissures and deliberate incisions in the bark, followed by drying and sorting into tears, chunks, or powders suitable for combustion (1)(4). Selective tapping and seasonal timing—often during drier months—are used to optimize resin quality while minimizing harm to the tree (1)(4).

Ritual deployment. Across settings, the act of burning copal formalizes intention and opens communicative channels:

- Combustion and fumigation: Resin pieces are placed on hot coals or charcoal embers within censers, clay copaleras, or metal burners. As the resin melts and volatilizes, dense aromatic smoke is wafted with feathers, leaf bundles, or by hand to bathe people, ritual objects, instruments, and thresholds in protective fragrance (3)(6). 
- Household and communal altars: Copal is lit at home altars, shrine rooms, and community plazas—especially during feast days, funerals, and commemorations—to invite ancestors, sanctify offerings, and accompany prayers (2)(3).
- Processions and gravesites: During Dia de los Muertos and other commemorations, censers accompany processions; copal burned at gravesides is understood to guide and nourish the returning dead, reinforcing kinship ties across worlds (2)(3).
- Divination and diagnosis: In some Otomi and Huasteca traditions, ritual specialists observe patterns and movements in the smoke for diagnostic insight or guidance, integrating the resin’s behavior into a broader suite of omen-reading practices (1).
- Visionary ceremonies: Among Amazonian and Andean specialists, copal (Protium spp.) and palo santo are ignited to cleanse ceremonial spaces, align participants, and “seat” protective forces. In contexts where [[Ayahuasca]] is shared, incense marks the beginning and end of sessions and is occasionally used mid-ceremony to “reset the air” or to support a patient during challenging passages (1).

Techniques and combinations. Resin grades may be blended to modulate ignition and aroma; powders can be sprinkled for swift bursts, while larger tears provide sustained burn. Practitioners sometimes combine copal with other aromatics or with prayer bundles, synchronizing ignition with invocations or songs. Gestures such as earth-kissing, circling the altar (“rounding”), and directional offerings organize the space and signal movements of protection and permission (2)(3).

Pedagogy and transmission. Skills of selection, harvesting, resin grading, and ritual choreography are transmitted through family lines and apprenticeship. Initiates learn to match resin types to ritual purpose, to read smoke comportment, and to integrate incense with other modalities (prayer, song, diet, spatial design), sustaining a living curriculum of aromatic ritual technologies (1)(3).

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability pressures. Rising global demand for “copal,” “white copal,” and “palo santo” has increased pressure on wild populations, especially in regions where slow-growing species are harvested unsustainably or where supply chains mingle resins from multiple taxa without clear provenance (4)(7). Overharvesting, destructive tapping, and cutting for wood compromise regeneration and degrade habitats, particularly in seasonally dry forests with slow recovery times (4).

Stewardship practices. Community-led management—rotational tapping, protection of seed trees, harvest moratoria, and enrichment planting—can sustain resin yields while preserving forest structure. Prioritizing naturally fallen palo santo wood, rather than cutting live trees, reduces impact where feasible (1)(4). Transparent, traceable sourcing helps align commercial demand with ecological realities (4)(7).

Biocultural rights and benefit-sharing. Incense traditions are inseparable from the communities that steward them. Ethical engagement requires recognizing the cultural provenance of copal use and supporting equitable benefit-sharing when products are commercialized. This includes fair pricing to harvesters, support for local governance of resin resources, and respect for ritual protocols and intellectual property embodied in songs, prayers, and ceremonial designs (1)(2)(4)(7).

Guidance for researchers and practitioners. 
- Source from community-run or certified traceable suppliers; prefer harvests documented as non-destructive and regionally appropriate (4)(7).
- Avoid generic “copal” where the species and origin are unknown; request species-level information and harvesting details (4).
- In ceremonial contexts, honor local authority, seek consent, and reciprocate materially and relationally with host communities. When integrating copal into practices outside its homelands, maintain clarity about origins, meaning, and limits of transposition (1)(2).

Public education and policy. Outreach that clarifies distinctions between Bursera- and Protium-derived copals, explains harvest impacts, and promotes best practices can reduce inadvertent harm. Where appropriate, recognition of ritual traditions within cultural heritage frameworks may bolster community control over resources and associated knowledge (3).
