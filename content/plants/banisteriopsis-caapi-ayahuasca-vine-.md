title: Banisteriopsis caapi (Ayahuasca Vine)
summary: Banisteriopsis caapi—known as the ayahuasca vine, caapi, or yagé—is the principal botanical source of β-carbolines in traditional ayahuasca brews, enabling oral DMT activity via reversible MAO-A inhibition. This article synthesizes ethnobotanical context, taxonomy, pharmacology, and key features of this venerated Amazonian “plant teacher.”

## Overview
Banisteriopsis caapi—commonly called ayahuasca vine, caapi, or yagé—is central to the preparation of ayahuasca in Amazonian traditions, providing the β‑carboline alkaloids that enable the oral psychoactivity of DMT by inhibiting monoamine oxidase A (MAO‑A) [1][2][4]. Venerated as a plant teacher and healer, B. caapi anchors ritual, divinatory, and therapeutic practices across the Northwest and Western Amazon [1][4][10].

## Traditional Use
Indigenous peoples throughout the Amazon have used B. caapi for centuries in religious, healing, and divinatory contexts, often as the foundational component of ayahuasca brews [1][4][10]. The vine is typically combined with the leaves of Psychotria viridis (chacruna), which supply N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) [4][6]. Regional traditions vary; among some groups such as the Awajún (Peru), B. caapi preparations are consumed without DMT-containing admixtures for spiritual insight or purgative purposes [2]. Across these traditions, B. caapi is regarded as a teacher-plant and primary healer within the broader pharmacopeia of Amazonian plant knowledge [1][10].

## Pharmacology
The stems and bark of B. caapi are rich in β‑carboline alkaloids—principally harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine (THH) [3][4][6]. Reported total β‑carboline content in stems ranges from approximately 0.11–0.83%, with harmine commonly comprising 40–96% of the total alkaloid fraction [3]. These β‑carbolines act as potent, reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO‑A), thereby preventing rapid gastrointestinal and hepatic degradation of orally ingested DMT and enabling its psychoactive effects within ayahuasca [2][4][6]. Beyond their enabling role, β‑carbolines possess intrinsic pharmacological activities—including psychotropic effects, mild central nervous system stimulation, and reported antiparasitic properties—and may be used alone in some traditions for their purgative or visionary qualities [2][3]. B. caapi is commonly propagated vegetatively and cultivated by specialists (e.g., shamans, healers) across the Amazon basin [3][5].

## Botany and Cultivation
B. caapi is a large, woody liana that can exceed 20–30 meters in length, bearing infrequent pink to pale flowers and producing characteristic fan-shaped samaras (seeds) [5][11][12]. In traditional and contemporary cultivation, cuttings are preferred for clonal propagation and reliability of alkaloid profile, with diverse landraces maintained by practitioners throughout its range [3][5]. The species is distributed across the western and northwestern Amazon, with occurrences documented in herbarium and biodiversity databases [5][11].
