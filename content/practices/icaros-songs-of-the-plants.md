## Abstract
Icaros are healing songs central to Amazonian plant medicine traditions, primarily among Indigenous and mestizo groups of the Upper Amazon basin. As core features of ritual practice, they are widely understood to channel the agency or “voice” of plant spirits, especially during ceremonial work with psychoactive teacher plants such as ayahuasca. Icaros are often received through dietas—periods of seclusion and dietary restriction in which healers apprentice with specific plant spirits. In ceremony, the performance and reception of icaros mediate social, psychological, and somatic healing, functioning as both a vector for plant-derived knowledge and a musical expression of Amazonian cosmovision [1][3][4][6]. Contemporary circulation of icaros across international retreat settings and recordings has broadened their influence while raising questions about cultural integrity, intellectual property, and the stewardship of biocultural heritage [1][4].

## Botanical Classification
Icaros are not a botanical taxon but a ritual-musical practice embedded within diverse plant lineages of Amazonia. Their performance and reception are inseparable from the ecological and pharmacological contexts of teacher plants, whose “voices” are believed to be sung through the healer. Core associated taxa include:

- Ayahuasca vine: [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] (Malpighiaceae) and admixture leaf: [[Psychotria viridis]] (Rubiaceae), central to many Upper Amazonian ceremonies in which icaros are learned, performed, and perceived [1][3][4].
- Ceremonial tobacco: [[Nicotiana rustica]] (Solanaceae), used for protection, grounding, and the act of blowing (soplada), which is etymologically linked to the term icaro (from Quechua ikaray, “to blow smoke over in order to heal”) [1][2].
- Brugmansia spp. (Solanaceae), often called toé, associated with specialized lineages (toésceros) and distinct visionary repertoires, approached with strict ritual controls due to their potency [1][3].
- “Paleros” or wood-based lineages draw on hardwoods and aromatic barks in decoctions and dietas; particular trees are thought to confer unique song repertoires and protective icaros [1][3].
- A wide array of non-psychoactive “master plants” (plantas maestras) are also dieted for their healing virtues and song transmissions, including shrubs, trees, and vines respected for their protective or restorative qualities [1][3][9].

Within this matrix, icaro repertoires are plant-specific: songs are identified with particular species or personified plant spirits, and their melodic or textual features are said to “carry” the remedial power of those beings into the ceremonial field [1][3][9]. This plant-linked classification of songs operates alongside human lineages (Shipibo-Konibo onánya, mestizo vegetalistas) and ceremonial roles (protective, diagnostic, cleansing), reflecting a biocultural system rather than a single species framework [1][3].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
The practice of singing icaros is centered in the western and Upper Amazon, particularly in regions of Peru (Ucayali, Loreto), Brazil (Acre, Amazonas), and Colombia (Putumayo and adjacent lowland corridors), with cultural expressions among Shipibo-Konibo, Ashaninka, Quechua-speaking communities, and mestizo populations engaged in vegetalismo [1][3]. While the term icaro is now widespread in Peruvian Amazonian Spanish, local names and linguistic forms persist, such as the Shipibo-Konibo “rao bewá,” often glossed as “medicine songs” [3][8].

Ecologically, icaros emerge from forest lifeways structured by floodplain and terra firme habitats that sustain teacher plants, medicinal trees, and the isolation sites required for dietas. The forest is not merely a backdrop but an agentive environment: rivers, birds, insects, and wind sounds often inform the melodic contours and timbral qualities of songs learned in seclusion [1][3]. Tobacco gardens, ayahuasca chacras, and diet huts situated on the forest edge or deeper in the bush support the apprenticeship ecology in which icaros are received and practiced.

In the last several decades, icaros have circulated beyond their homelands through international retreat centers, recordings, and performances, creating diasporic spaces of practice in Andean cities, North America, and Europe [1][4][6]. These new contexts expand the audience and function of icaros (therapeutic, spiritual, performative) while intensifying debates over authenticity, translation, and the appropriate stewardship of Indigenous ritual forms [1][4][6].

## Ethnobotanical Context
In Shipibo-Konibo ceremonial cosmology, rao bewá are regarded as the most essential healing instrument of the onánya (healer). The healer’s diagnostic and therapeutic actions unfold through songs that are selected or improvised according to the perceived needs of each patient, often guided by visions and spirit communication mediated by ayahuasca or tobacco [3][8]. Songs may be addressed to specific plant spirits, river beings, or protective entities; the melodic line is understood to “arrange” and “clean” the body of the patient, restoring order where illness or malevolent forces have introduced disorder [1][3].

Among mestizo vegetalistas, apprenticeships revolve around dietas with master plants that “teach” both the melodies and verbal formulas of icaros, as well as the ethical protocols governing their use. Repertoires are functionally differentiated: cleansing and purgative songs (for removing pathogenic or intrusive energies), protective and sealing songs (to establish safe ceremonial space), navigational or guiding songs (to orient vision and insight), and songs for extraction or confrontation, sometimes involving specific breath work and the ceremonial blowing of tobacco smoke (sopladas) [1][3][9]. Whistled icaros, rhythmic use of the rattle (chakapa), and oscillation between Spanish, Indigenous languages, and vocables are widely attested [1][3][6].

Icaros are also embedded in a broader aesthetic of synesthesia linking sound, vision, and design. Shipibo-Konibo textile arts and body painting often map song patterns into geometric motifs that are “seen” during visionary states and then “sung” back into the body of the patient, articulating a reciprocal relation between pattern and melody [2][3][4]. In contemporary retreat settings, these musical-visual correspondences are commonly framed in therapeutic terms—emotional catharsis, trauma processing, and integration—while remaining rooted in Indigenous ontologies of plant agency and reciprocity [1][4][6].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
As intangible cultural expressions, icaros do not have intrinsic chemical constituents; their effects are understood within ritual ecologies that include psychoactive and medicinal plants, attentional states, and social dynamics. During ayahuasca ceremonies, β-carboline alkaloids from [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] (e.g., harmine, harmaline) inhibit monoamine oxidase A, enabling oral activity of tryptamines such as N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) present in admixture plants like [[Psychotria viridis]]. Within this pharmacological window, the structured use of icaros is reported to shape attentional focus, visionary imagery, affective tone, and perceived somatic flows [1][3][5]. Ceremonial tobacco ([[Nicotiana rustica]])—rich in nicotine and other alkaloids—is used for grounding, protection, and breath-mediated techniques (sopladas) thought to cleanse or seal patients; specialized lineages working with Brugmansia spp. engage a distinct and potent tropane alkaloid pharmacology that is tightly controlled and ritualized [1][3].

Healers often describe icaros as synesthetic: melodic lines correspond to visual patterns or “paths” that can be followed, tightened, untangled, or woven into the patient’s body, a notion echoed in the translation of songs into textile designs among Shipibo-Konibo artists [2][3][4]. Listeners report experiences consistent with music-evoked imagery, rhythmic entrainment, and modulation of arousal. In qualitative accounts, icaros may precipitate emotional release, recalibrate breathing, and structure the trajectory of visions, contributing to a sense of narrative coherence and communal bonding within the ceremonial setting [1][5][6].

From an anthropological perspective, the efficacy of icaros is multivalent: it arises from plant pharmacodynamics, the ritual authority and intention of the healer, the semantic and sonic features of the song (including glossolalia and onomatopoeia), and the collective field of attention established among participants [1][6]. Icaros also encode and transmit ecological knowledge—naming plants, rivers, animals, and protective beings—thus functioning as mnemonic devices and channels for the continuity of plant-human relations [1][3][9]. While biomedical research on icaros per se remains nascent, ethnographic and phenomenological reports converge on their centrality to the timing, framing, and perceived outcomes of Amazonian plant medicine rituals [1][3][5][6].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Icaros are classically acquired through dietas—a disciplined apprenticeship in which the practitioner enters seclusion, adheres to dietary and social taboos, and consumes prescribed master plants under the guidance of an experienced healer [3][8]. Common elements include:

- Seclusion in forest or semi-forest settings, with restricted contact and minimal stimulation to heighten receptivity to dreams, visions, and subtle plant communications [3].
- Dietary constraints, typically avoiding salt, sugar, fats, alcohol, and spices, alongside sexual abstinence, to maintain energetic “cleanliness” and align with the plant’s tutelary presence [3][8].
- Nightly or periodic ingestion of plant preparations at carefully determined doses, aimed not at intoxication per se but at establishing a channel for the plant spirit to teach songs, healing methods, and ethical conduct [1][3][8].

During dietas, apprentices report receiving melodies, textual formulas, and specific “powers” or virtues associated with a plant—sometimes in dreams, at other times during waking visionary states. The songs are memorized, refined, and later adapted in ceremony to the diagnostic and therapeutic needs of patients. Senior healers may improvise in response to evolving ceremonial dynamics, weaving known motifs with spontaneous variations that they attribute to the guiding plant spirits [1][3][8].

A typical ceremonial arc includes:
- Opening icaros to protect the space, invoke plant allies, and attune participants to the ritual frame.
- Diagnostic and cleansing icaros directed to individuals, often accompanied by the rhythmic rustling of the chakapa and strategic sopladas of tobacco smoke to cleanse, fortify, or “seal” targeted areas of the body.
- Navigational songs that stabilize or redirect challenging visions, calm agitation, or deepen inquiry, employing shifts in tempo, register, and timbre.
- Closing icaros that harmonize the group, reaffirm protections, and curtail residual visionary overstimulation [3][4][6].

In transmission, icaro knowledge is guarded by ethical norms. Apprentices are expected to cultivate humility, restraint, and discernment, completing extended dietas before receiving permission to sing certain “power songs” publicly. Some songs remain restricted within lineages or families, reflecting both respect for plant allies and concerns about misuse or commercialization [1][8][9]. With the expansion of recording technologies and global audiences, icaros now circulate on albums and streaming platforms, making documentation and attribution practices vital to safeguard Indigenous authorship and contextual integrity [1][4][8].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
The global resurgence of interest in Amazonian plant medicines has intensified pressures on both cultural and ecological systems that sustain icaros. Key considerations include:

- Cultural integrity and initiation pathways: Preserving apprenticeship structures (dietas, lineage permissions, ritual protocols) helps protect the depth and nuance of icaro knowledge from dilution, misinterpretation, or decontextualized therapeutic appropriation [1][4].
- Biocultural rights and intellectual property: Icaros are often understood as collectively held cultural expressions, with responsibilities shared across families and nations. Ethical research and publication call for prior informed consent, clear acknowledgement of Indigenous authorship, and equitable benefit-sharing when recordings, translations, or performances are disseminated [8][9].
- Conservation of teacher plants and habitats: Sustainable cultivation and harvesting of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]], admixture species, and other master plants are necessary for the continuity of dietas. Habitat protection for lowland forests, river corridors, and culturally significant sites ensures the ecological conditions under which apprenticeship and ceremony remain viable [4][9].
- Responsible globalization: Retreat centers and mediators should develop community-informed protocols for training, representation, and revenue-sharing; support language preservation and local education; and partner with Indigenous organizations to co-create standards for the respectful hosting and circulation of icaros [1][4][6].

These measures align with a broader ethic of reciprocity: honoring the plants, lineages, and territories from which icaros arise while enabling cross-cultural dialogue under conditions that protect both knowledge sovereignty and forest ecologies [1][4][9].
