## Abstract
Bursera graveolens, widely known as Palo Santo (“holy wood”), is a deciduous tree of the Burseraceae native to tropical dry forests of western South America. The fragrant heartwood and aged deadfall are central to Andean–Amazonian smoke offerings, household purification, and healing rites. As an aromatic material used by Indigenous and mestizo ritual specialists as well as in domestic contexts, Palo Santo anchors ceremonial “limpias” and protection practices and is increasingly present in global wellness markets. Its wood and distilled oil contain volatile terpenoids that confer distinctive scent profiles and likely insect-repellent properties; however, pharmacological evidence in humans remains limited and often anecdotal. The species’ cultural importance intersects with ecological constraints: regeneration in seasonally dry forests is episodic, while demand for incense sticks and essential oils has intensified pressures on wild populations. This article synthesizes botanical identity, distribution, ethnographic roles, preparation methods, chemistry, conservation concerns, and ethical considerations, drawing on regional floristics, ethnobotanical accounts, and trade assessments (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005; Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Cunningham et al. 2016; McBride et al. 2013; Vera et al. 2020; Linares et al. 2010; Bakkali et al. 2008; Tafur et al. 2021).

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae  
- Clade: Angiosperms  
- Family: Burseraceae  
- Genus: Bursera  
- Species: Bursera graveolens (Kunth) Triana & Planch.

Bursera graveolens belongs to the incense-bearing Burseraceae, a family that also includes frankincense (Boswellia spp.) and myrrh (Commiphora spp.), genera long associated with resinous aromatics and ritual economies (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005). B. graveolens is typically a small to medium-sized deciduous tree, generally reaching 8–12 m in height, with a rounded crown and a straight to slightly tortuous trunk. The bark is gray to silvery, exfoliating in thin patches, revealing pale inner cortex—an appearance shared with congeners adapted to seasonal drought. Leaves are small, aromatic when crushed, and usually trifoliate to pinnate with entire to slightly serrulate margins; they are shed during the pronounced dry season, an adaptation to water stress in semi-arid environments (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005; Cunningham et al. 2016).

The species’ notable organoleptic qualities are concentrated in the heartwood and in aged, naturally fallen branches. As is common within Burseraceae, the wood and cortex host secretory tissues where terpenoid-rich volatiles accumulate over time. Traditional preference for weathered deadfall reflects both ritual protocol and a practical awareness that resinous notes intensify post-abscission as tissues dry and secondary metabolites concentrate (Cunningham et al. 2016; Vera et al. 2020).

Flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, likely insect-pollinated, appearing with the onset of the rainy season; fruits are drupaceous and dehiscent, exposing arillate seeds that are dispersed by birds and other fauna within mosaic dry-forest landscapes. While the species shows morphological variability across its range, local recognition is consistent, and it is distinguished from other woody incense sources by its sweet, citrus–balsamic aroma released on gentle smoldering (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Bursera graveolens is native to semi-arid and dry tropical forests spanning the Pacific slope and inter-Andean valleys of western South America, with core distributions in Ecuador and Peru and occurrences extending southward toward northern Argentina (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005). It is characteristic of coastal and intermontane dry-forest ecoregions where annual rainfall is strongly seasonal, evapotranspiration is high, and soils range from rocky colluvial substrates to well-drained sandy and loamy profiles. These forests exhibit open canopies, marked leaf-off seasons, and periodic fire and grazing pressures; B. graveolens persists as a drought-tolerant element within these dynamic mosaics.

In Ecuador and northern Peru, the species occupies low to mid-elevations within coastal dry forests, foothill slopes, and interior valleys. Phenology is tied to the onset of rains: leaf flush, flowering, and subsequent fruiting are synchronized with wet-season pulses, while the extended dry season triggers leaf abscission and a metabolic shift to conserve water. Mortality events following droughts and storms contribute to the pool of deadfall from which culturally preferred aromatic wood is collected, highlighting an ecological cycle that underpins traditional use (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005; Vera et al. 2020).

Habitat fragmentation from agricultural expansion, charcoal production, and urbanization has reduced contiguous stands of dry forest in much of the species’ range. Nonetheless, B. graveolens can regenerate from seed where remnant patches persist and where dispersers maintain functional connectivity. Experimental work on germination and early regeneration in Ecuadorian dry forests indicates capacity for nursery propagation and restoration plantings when seed sources and microsite conditions are managed appropriately (Vera et al. 2020). Because scent intensity and oil profiles are influenced by site conditions and wood age, local provenance and habitat history may affect the qualities sought by ritual specialists and by the incense trade (Cunningham et al. 2016).

## Ethnobotanical Context
Palo Santo is interwoven with the ritual life and everyday practices of Indigenous and mestizo communities across western South America. Among Quechua, Shuar, and Kichwa peoples, the fragrant smoke is directed toward ceremonial purification, spiritual protection, and healing—applications that extend from household thresholds to community altars (Linares et al. 2010). In the broader Andean cosmological frame, smoke offerings are rendered to the apus (mountain spirits) and to Pachamama (Earth Mother) as a materialized gesture of respect, reciprocity, and supplication; the aromatic plume mediates between ritual actors and spirit interlocutors (Linares et al. 2010).

Within mestizo curanderismo, Palo Santo supports cleansing rites such as [[Limpia]] and is integrated into protective works and rites of passage. Curanderos commonly juxtapose its sweet, balsamic smoke with the forceful breath (soplo) of tobacco and with the visionary work of “teacher plants,” especially within [[Ayahuasca]] ceremonies. In these settings, Palo Santo may be burned before, during, or after visionary sessions to mark ritual boundaries, settle agitation, and restore equilibrium. Its use often accompanies or follows the administration of decoctions derived from [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and, in tobacco-lineage work, the blowing or ingestion of preparations from [[Nicotiana rustica]] (“mapacho”) (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Linares et al. 2010).

Beyond explicitly ceremonial contexts, Palo Santo functions as a household aromatic and practical aid: smoldering splints freshen rooms, mask malodors, and repel insects, especially in warm seasons when vectors are abundant (McBride et al. 2013). In this domestic register it supports a continuum of “spiritual hygiene” and everyday well-being, reflecting a permeability between sacred and mundane domains in Andean–Amazonian practice.

Translocal and global circulations have also reshaped the plant’s social life. Urban ritualists and wellness practitioners employ Palo Santo in yoga studios, retreats, and therapeutic spaces, echoing traditional aims of purification while reframing them within contemporary mind–body idioms. These novel contexts have generated both appreciation and critique: while some Indigenous and mestizo practitioners see opportunities for cultural sharing and livelihood diversification, others caution against decontextualization, exoticization, and the erasure of rights-holder voices (Cunningham et al. 2016; Tafur et al. 2021; McBride et al. 2013).

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
The distinctive fragrance of B. graveolens derives from a suite of volatile terpenoids concentrated in the heartwood and aged deadfall. Reported constituents include monoterpenes and oxygenated terpenoids such as limonene, α-terpineol, and carvone, compounds collectively responsible for citrus, minty, and balsamic notes that manifest robustly when wood is smoldered or when essential oil is distilled (Bakkali et al. 2008; Vera et al. 2020; Cunningham et al. 2016). As with other members of Burseraceae, compositional profiles may vary with tree age, microhabitat, and post-fall aging, factors that traditional protocols skillfully leverage by favoring naturally seasoned material (Cunningham et al. 2016).

Pharmacological claims surrounding Palo Santo center on anxiolytic, calming, and anti-inflammatory effects associated with inhalation of volatile terpenes. Mechanistic plausibility follows from the known bioactivities of monoterpenes and from olfactory-limbic pathways through which aromatics may modulate affect and autonomic tone (Bakkali et al. 2008). Nonetheless, the empirical base specific to B. graveolens remains sparse: controlled human studies are limited, and many assertions are extrapolated from broader essential oil literature or from traditional knowledge and practitioner reports. Similarly, insect-repellent effects are plausible given monoterpene profiles but require setting-specific evaluation (Bakkali et al. 2008; McBride et al. 2013).

Burning practices also entail general considerations related to indoor smoke exposure. While Palo Santo is typically used in brief, intermittent sessions with smolder rather than open flame, smoke generation produces particulates alongside desirable volatiles. Practitioners commonly emphasize ventilation and short burn durations to balance ritual intentions with comfort and safety, an approach that aligns with cautious, low-exposure aromatherapy norms (Cunningham et al. 2016). In distilled form, essential oil is used topically in diluted preparations and via diffusers; as with all concentrated aromatics, dermal sensitivity and dose-response uncertainties warrant conservative application and attention to contraindications inferred from essential oil toxicology (Bakkali et al. 2008).

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Harvest protocols emphasize ecological respect and ritual propriety. In customary practice, wood is collected from naturally fallen branches and trunks rather than from live felling. The fallen pieces are allowed to age—commonly for at least two years—until the heartwood dries and aromatic resins concentrate; this temporal interval is said to deepen both fragrance and “energetic” potency (Vera et al. 2020; Cunningham et al. 2016). Collectors and healers frequently articulate rules of place and time, approaching trees and collection sites with offerings or prayers to acknowledge the plant’s agency and the forest’s guardians.

For ceremonial use, the wood is cut into slender splints or chips. A splint is briefly ignited, then allowed to smolder, releasing a light, sweet smoke. The practitioner may fan the smoke with the hand, a feather, or bundled leaves, directing it over the person receiving a [[Limpia]], around an altar, or through the four directions of a room. In curanderismo, this act of sahumar (fumigation) is synchronized with song, breath, and intention, supporting cleansing, protection, and the restoration of harmonious relations among participants and with the nonhuman world (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Linares et al. 2010).

Within [[Ayahuasca]] settings, Palo Santo can serve to demarcate ritual thresholds—beginning and closing prayers—or to recalibrate the atmosphere during challenging phases of the ceremony. Curanderos may alternate its use with the soplo of [[Nicotiana rustica]] smoke or with the rattling and song that guide collective attention. Outside strictly ceremonial frames, household use follows pragmatic rhythms: a splint is lit at dusk to freshen air and dissuade insects, or during times of illness and conflict to clear stagnant “airs” and invite calm (McBride et al. 2013).

Modern markets have diversified preparation forms. Beyond hand-cut splints, producers offer pressed cones, incense blends, and steam-distilled essential oil. The latter is used in diffusers, perfumes, and topical balms, often blended with other aromatics. Market growth has prompted debates over authenticity, efficacy, and ethics: questions arise about whether plantation-grown or freshly felled wood matches the olfactory character of aged deadfall, and whether distant consumption detaches practice from the ecologies and communities that steward the species (Cunningham et al. 2016; McBride et al. 2013). In response, some community-led initiatives specify traceable, deadfall-only sourcing, local value addition, and ritual protocols embedded in harvest routines, thereby aligning commerce with cultural values (Vera et al. 2020; Cunningham et al. 2016).

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Conservation concerns reflect the confluence of ecological sensitivity and globally amplified demand. Tropical dry forests in Ecuador, Peru, and adjacent regions have undergone extensive conversion and fragmentation, diminishing habitat and disrupting regeneration dynamics critical for B. graveolens. Increased international trade in incense sticks and essential oils adds extractive pressure, especially where governance is weak and monitoring is limited (Cunningham et al. 2016; McBride et al. 2013).

Analyses of trade have called attention to the need for clear standards that privilege naturally fallen wood and that disincentivize premature harvests that remove standing biomass before resin maturation. Community-based management—combining patrols, fall monitoring, seed collection, and nursery propagation—offers pathways to harmonize livelihoods with forest stewardship. Experimental and field studies indicate that germination and seedling establishment are feasible under managed conditions, supporting restoration plantings and enrichment in degraded stands (Vera et al. 2020). Such efforts are more effective when embedded within local governance structures and customary norms, recognizing that ritual economies and ecological cycles are mutually constitutive.

Ethically, biocultural rights are central. Respect for Indigenous and local knowledge systems entails free, prior, and informed consent in research, transparency regarding the purposes and beneficiaries of documentation, and fair benefit-sharing where commercial value is generated. For consumers and allied practitioners, due diligence includes verifying origin, seeking community-affiliated suppliers, preferring deadfall-sourced material, and avoiding extractive price dynamics that erode on-the-ground stewardship (McBride et al. 2013; Cunningham et al. 2016). In academic and media representations, careful language can avoid decontextualizing ritual practice or conflating diverse “Palo Santo” species, thereby maintaining taxonomic and cultural specificity.

Regulatory discussions have considered Bursera graveolens within the ambit of international frameworks for wildlife trade; engagement with CITES considerations underscores the desirability of transparent supply chains, accurate labeling, and traceability protocols capable of distinguishing legal, sustainable sources from illicit or ecologically harmful ones (Cunningham et al. 2016). While legal regimes vary by country, convergent principles—community governance, habitat conservation, and documentation of origin—are widely applicable.

Ultimately, sustaining Palo Santo’s cultural life requires sustaining its forests. Policies that protect and restore dry-forest mosaics, recognize customary access and stewardship, and channel market demand toward locally managed value chains are more likely to secure both ecological resilience and cultural continuity (Vera et al. 2020; McBride et al. 2013). For the Yaogará Ark, these considerations frame a living ethnobotany attentive to the rights of knowledge holders and the integrity of the ecosystems that ground ritual practice.
