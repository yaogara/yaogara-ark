## Abstract
Tabernaemontana sananho—locally known as Uchu Sanango—is a medicinal shrub native to the Amazon basin, highly valued for its role in strength-building diets and as an initiatory plant in Indigenous shamanic practice. Traditionally administered as potent eye drops called sananga, this plant features prominently in ceremonial contexts for its purported ability to sharpen perception, promote physical and emotional cleansing, and facilitate spiritual preparation. Pharmacological analysis highlights indole alkaloids with psychoactive and neuroactive properties, yet sustainable management and ethical engagement remain critical due to increasing global interest and ecological pressures (Barnes n.d.[2]; Sankofa Mind + Body n.d.[4]).

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae  
- Clade: Angiosperms  
- Order: Gentianales  
- Family: Apocynaceae  
- Genus: Tabernaemontana  
- Species: Tabernaemontana sananho

Tabernaemontana sananho is a medium-sized, evergreen shrub characterized by opposite, glossy leaves, fragrant white to cream corollas, and a latex-bearing (milky) sap typical of Apocynaceae. The plant exudes abundant white latex when damaged. Roots and bark are the principal materials for sananga preparations, valued for their dense sap and alkaloid content. Fruits in many Tabernaemontana species are paired follicles; seeds are often embedded in orange arils, attracting frugivores. While the reproductive biology of T. sananho is not comprehensively documented, it is broadly consistent with genus-level traits.

Reports from Indigenous practitioners and regional ethnobotanical sources note that T. sananho is sometimes confused with closely related species such as T. undulata; however, local healers distinguish them by subtle differences in leaf morphology, habitat, sap characteristics, and perceived medicinal effects (Sankofa Mind + Body n.d.[4]; Make It Sacred n.d.[5]; Shamanic Supply n.d.[6]). Careful field identification—ideally with voucher specimens and Indigenous guidance—is recommended where supply chains now include cultivated and wild-harvested material under overlapping vernacular names.

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
T. sananho is native to humid lowland forests across the upper Amazon basin and is reported most frequently in Peru, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador (Sankofa Mind + Body n.d.[4]; Make It Sacred n.d.[5]; Shamanic Supply n.d.[6]). It tends to occupy shaded to semi-shaded understories of terra firme forest, edges of secondary growth, and occasionally transitional zones bordering seasonally inundated (várzea) forest. The species appears to prefer well-drained, nutrient-moderate to nutrient-rich soils, with high ambient humidity and temperatures typical of equatorial rainforest climates.

Field observations by practitioners suggest the plant can be locally abundant around Indigenous community gardens and fallows where it may be stewarded or tolerated in situ. Altitudinal distribution is expected to lie primarily below 800 m, in alignment with other lowland Amazonian Tabernaemontana taxa. Flowering and fruiting likely follow regional rainfall patterns, with peak anthesis at the onset or within the main rainy season, though robust phenological data remain limited.

As a latex-bearing shrub, T. sananho interacts ecologically with herbivores and pollinators adapted to Apocynaceae defenses and floral traits. The fragrant, tubular flowers are consistent with insect pollination syndromes, and the genus commonly recruits frugivores for seed dispersal. These ecological relationships—while not fully documented for T. sananho—should be considered when designing conservation actions, especially in mosaics of forest, fallow, and cultivated plots.

## Ethnobotanical Context
Uchu Sanango holds a revered place in Amazonian medicinal culture, particularly among the Matsés, Yawanawá, Huni Kuin, and Kaxinawá peoples. Its primary applications include:

- Strength during diets (dieta): Initiates and healers ingest or apply sananho to build resilience, cleanse the body, and prepare for further plant-based spiritual learning.
- Vision Enhancement: Hunters and warriors utilize eye drops (sananga) for acute visual and perceptual clarity in dense rainforest environments, facilitating successful hunting and subtle movement detection (Barnes n.d.[2]; Sankofa Mind + Body n.d.[4]).
- Spiritual Preparation: Sanango is often administered before visionary rituals—such as ayahuasca ceremonies—to purify “panema” (spiritual blockages, lethargy), and attune the mind to deeper insights (Shamans Cave n.d.[3]; Sankofa Mind + Body n.d.[4]).
- Emotional and Energetic Cleansing: Some traditions employ sanango in emotional healing sessions for relieving anxiety, sadness, and energetic “heaviness”, believed fundamental to Amazonian concepts of health (Barnes n.d.[2]).

Within ceremonial settings, sananga may be used to ready participants for encounters with other teacher plants and rites, including [[preparations/ayahuasca]] ceremonies typically involving [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]] and [[plants/psychotria-viridis]]. In some communities, sananga accompanies pre-ceremonial protocols (abstinences, fasting, bathing) and is paired with tobacco prayers using [[plants/nicotiana-rustica]] to focus intention and protection.

Contemporary non-Indigenous use has expanded into holistic wellness circles, with sanango recognized for its potential effects on focus, emotional clarity, and spiritual self-exploration (Make It Sacred n.d.[5]; Shamanic Supply n.d.[6]). This diffusion has occurred alongside broader global interest in Amazonian medicines, intensifying debates about cultural authority, transmission of practice, and the boundaries of appropriate ceremonial adaptation.

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
The main bioactive constituents of T. sananho are indole alkaloids, notably:
- Ibogaine: Investigated for neuroplasticity, mental clarity, and anti-addictive properties.
- Voacangine
- Coronaridine

These compounds interact with neurotransmitter systems, especially NMDA and serotonergic pathways, and have been shown to promote increases in neurogenesis, nociceptive modulation (pain relief), and cognitive function (Sankofa Mind + Body n.d.[4]; Make It Sacred n.d.[5]). However, pharmacological research is limited, with most studies focusing on related Tabernaemontana species or isolated alkaloids in laboratory settings.

Tabernaemontana is a chemically diverse genus; beyond the iboga-type alkaloids listed above, species within the group commonly contain a suite of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, some with notable central nervous system activity. Inferences about T. sananho’s bioactivity therefore draw partly from chemotaxonomic analogies, underscoring the need for species-specific profiling, standardized extraction, and robust quality control. Published reviews of iboga alkaloids report actions across multiple receptor systems, including kappa-opioid, sigma, NMDA, and serotonin receptors, as well as potential neurotrophic effects; yet translation from in vitro and animal models to traditional ophthalmic use remains uncertain (Weston et al. 2005; Almeida et al. 2023) (Sankofa Mind + Body n.d.[4]; Make It Sacred n.d.[5]).

Ocular pharmacodynamics for sananga are not well characterized. Application is accompanied by an acute stinging sensation and pronounced lacrimation (tearing), attributed to activation of ocular nerve endings and a transient inflammatory response (Barnes n.d.[2]). Reports describe short-lived burning pain, followed by a period of heightened alertness and clarity, though mechanisms—ranging from peripheral sensory modulation to centrally mediated arousal—remain speculative. There is currently no clinical consensus regarding safety, dosage, or long-term effects of sanango alkaloids when administered as eye drops, with reports primarily based on ethnographic traditions and experiential accounts (Barnes n.d.[2]; Shamanic Supply n.d.[6]).

Given variable plant age, part used (root vs. bark), seasonal chemistry, and preparation techniques, alkaloid content can differ significantly between batches. These factors complicate attempts to quantify dose–response and safety margins. For these reasons, ethnopharmacological inquiry prioritizes:
- Verified botanical identity (including herbarium vouchers).
- Rigorous chemical characterization of preparations used in studies.
- Ocular safety assessments (sterility, pH, osmolarity, irritancy) aligned with ophthalmic standards.
- Culturally grounded protocols that reflect Indigenous preparation and administration.

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Preparation is highly ritualized, requiring skilled practitioners:

- Collection: Roots and bark are harvested with ecological and spiritual sensitivity, often during specific lunar phases or times designated by the elder healer (MemoryCherish n.d.[1]; Shamans Cave n.d.[3]).
- Processing: The material is cleaned, sun-dried, and ground to fine powder. Water or saline is added to create an infusion.
- Ceremonial Brewing: Shamans may fast, sing icaros (medicine songs), and pray during preparation to “enliven” the medicine and invoke plant spirits (MemoryCherish n.d.[1]; Shamans Cave n.d.[3]).
- Application: A ritual prayer or intention is set; then a single drop is placed directly into each eye—often using a shell, leaf, or modern dropper (MemoryCherish n.d.[1]; Shamans Cave n.d.[3]).
- Ceremonial Role: Sanango use commonly initiates diets (periods of strict food and substance restriction) aimed at increasing physical and spiritual resilience. In some traditions, repeated applications over days serve as deeper purification or preparation for advanced practices (Barnes n.d.[2]).

While protocols vary among peoples and lineages, several themes recur. Practitioners emphasize respectful harvesting and reciprocity with the plant, alignment with personal intention, and adherence to dietary and behavioral guidelines surrounding the session (abstinence from certain foods, alcohol, and sexual activity). In settings where sananga precedes [[preparations/ayahuasca]] work, it is framed as clearing visual and energetic fields to facilitate learning from master plants.

Hygienic considerations have become more prominent as use has expanded. Traditional implements—such as cleaned shells or leaves—are increasingly supplemented or replaced by dropper bottles. Contemporary practice in intercultural contexts often includes filtering of the infusion, attention to pH and saline balance, and the use of boiled or sterile water to avoid microbial contamination. These adaptations aim to preserve ceremonial integrity while addressing ocular safety. Acute effects typically include intense burning, watering of the eyes, transient photophobia, and reflexive blinking. Recipients generally remain seated or reclined during application, with guided breathing and song to navigate the discomfort until clarity returns (Sankofa Mind + Body n.d.[4]; Shamanic Supply n.d.[6]).

The experiential arc reported by practitioners and participants includes immediate intensity followed by a window of sharpened perception and calm alertness. Some lineages apply sananga in the early morning to support hunting focus; others reserve it for twilight or pre-ceremonial intervals to attune perception. Frequency and duration of a “sanango dieta” vary widely—from single sessions to daily applications over several days—modulated by the guidance of the healer and the participant’s aims (Barnes n.d.[2]).

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Wild populations of Tabernaemontana sananho are increasingly at risk due to habitat loss, overharvesting, and broader commercialization of Amazonian teacher plants (Sankofa Mind + Body n.d.[4]; Make It Sacred n.d.[5]). As demand for sananga rises, pressures on wild stands can escalate, particularly when roots are the primary harvested material. Ethical use therefore requires:

- Sustainable Harvesting: Prioritizing bark or aerial prunings over destructive root removal where culturally appropriate; propagating from cuttings; adopting rotational harvest schedules; and supporting regenerative cultivation near communities of origin.
- Cultural Rights: Recognizing that knowledge and practice belong to Indigenous peoples; ensuring Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) and equitable benefit-sharing for any biomedical, commercial, or educational use. Transparent agreements should document provenance, roles, and community priorities.
- Research Transparency: Collaborating with communities from project design through dissemination; co-developing safety protocols; depositing voucher specimens; and avoiding biopiracy. When possible, local training and infrastructure should be supported so communities can steward both plant and knowledge.
- Supply Chain Integrity: Preventing adulteration and mislabeling by implementing traceability, third-party identification, and community-certified sourcing. Clear labeling that distinguishes T. sananho from T. undulata and other congeners reduces confusion and helps protect cultural specificity.
- Habitat Protection: Supporting Indigenous land rights and conservation initiatives that safeguard forest matrices where T. sananho grows, including fallow mosaics and agroforestry corridors.

Emergent cultivation initiatives and community-based botanics projects seek to balance global interest with local sovereignty and biodiversity protection (Sankofa Mind + Body n.d.[4]; Shamans Cave n.d.[3]). Consumer and practitioner education—centered on origin transparency, respectful ceremony, and moderated demand—can help align intercultural practice with ecological limits and cultural continuity.
