## Abstract
Banisteriopsis rusbyana (syn. Diplopterys cabrerana, commonly known as tucunacá, chaliponga, or chagropanga) is a culturally and pharmacologically significant liana native to western Amazonia. Traditionally, its leaves are incorporated by Indigenous and mestizo Amazonian peoples into [[preparations/ayahuasca]] (yagé) brews as a principal admixture, prized for their high content of psychoactive tryptamines, particularly dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Though sometimes conflated with [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]], the classic source of ayahuasca’s β-carbolines, B. rusbyana is botanically distinct but nonetheless valued in traditional medicine and shamanic practice for its visionary properties, its role in divinatory ritual, and its contributions to plant-based pharmacological knowledge—warranting precise ethnobotanical documentation and sustainable stewardship[2][3][4].

## Botanical Classification
- Family: Malpighiaceae  
- Accepted name: Diplopterys cabrerana (Cuatrec.) B.Gates  
- Principal synonym: Banisteriopsis rusbyana (Nied.) Morton  
- Common names: tucunacá; chaliponga; chagropanga; chalipanga

Taxonomic notes:
- Diplopterys is closely related to Banisteriopsis within Malpighiaceae; D. cabrerana was long circulated under Banisteriopsis rusbyana in botanical and ethnobotanical literature. Modern treatments place the species in Diplopterys, with B. rusbyana retained as a widely used synonym in cultivation and trade[1][2][5][6].

Morphology:
- A robust, woody liana with opposite, entire, elliptic to obovate leaves that are generally coriaceous (leathery).  
- Inflorescences are axillary, forming small racemes or umbels typically with four-flowered units.  
- Flowers present the characteristic Malpighiaceae morphology with clawed petals and oil glands that can attract specialized pollinators.  
- The fruit is a three-winged samara, a diaspore adapted for water and wind-aided dispersal; the broad wings facilitate movement along riparian corridors[2][4][5].

Field identification considerations:
- The combination of opposite leathery leaves, axillary inflorescences, and three-winged samaras distinguishes Diplopterys from sympatric climbing taxa.  
- Herbarium confirmation relies on floral and fruit characters; vegetative similarity to some Banisteriopsis taxa can lead to misidentification without reproductive material[1][5].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Natural range:
- Native to the lowland Amazon Basin, documented in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and Venezuela[2][3][4][5].  
- Occurs from near sea level to lower montane foothills within humid tropical forests.

Habitat and ecology:
- Most frequently encountered in primary and well-developed secondary moist forests, especially along river banks, levees, and gallery forests where periodic flooding and high humidity favor rapid vegetative growth.  
- The three-winged samaras are well suited to hydrochory (water dispersal), aiding downstream spread in meandering river systems and floodplains[2][4][5].  
- In managed landscapes, the species is commonly cultivated in Indigenous and mestizo homegardens, often near dwellings for ease of access during ceremonial preparation and to protect select phenotypes deemed “potent” or “clear” in their visions[2][3][4][7].

Cultivation and phenology:
- Propagated by cuttings and transplants; growers and healers may maintain clonally derived lines carrying desirable psychoactive profiles.  
- Flowering and fruiting are considered comparatively infrequent in some localities, which can constrain seed availability and large-scale propagation[2].  
- In agroforestry mosaics, vines are trained on living supports or trellised, benefiting from partial canopy cover typical of forest edges and garden perimeters.

Conservation distribution notes:
- While the plant is widespread at the scale of the western Amazon, local abundance is heterogeneous. Wild stands may exist as scattered lianas in intact forest; persistent cultivation in gardens constitutes an important reservoir of genetic diversity maintained through cultural practice[2][3][4].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Cultural significance:
- B. rusbyana (tucunacá/chaliponga/chagropanga) is foundational among diverse Amazonian groups including Tukanoan, Kichwa, Shuar, and Secoya peoples[2][3][4].  
- Its principal role is as an ayahuasca admixture. Leaves are combined with the β‑carboline-rich vine [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]], enabling the orally active ingestion of DMT and shaping the phenomenology of visions, divination, and diagnostic insight during ceremony[2][3][4].

Roles in practice:
- Indigenous specialists—variously known as yagéceros or ayahuasqueros—select tucunacá/chaliponga for brews intended for divination, healing, and community ritual. Some mestizo curanderos prefer this admixture for its pronounced, vivid visual sequences and perceived “clarity” of informational content.  
- The plant is overwhelmingly used as an admixture; reports of its use as a substitute for B. caapi are rare and typically circumstantial or due to resource constraints[2][3][4].

Knowledge transmission:
- Seeds, cuttings, and plant lore circulate within kinship and apprenticeship networks, reinforcing the continuity of ceremonial styles and specific recipe lineages.  
- Planting and harvesting may observe calendrical and ecological cues (e.g., lunar phases, onset of rains), reflecting locally elaborated seasonalities and cosmologies tied to plant agency and “teacher” qualities[2][3][4].

Terminology and admixture ecologies:
- In many regions “chaliponga” or “chagropanga” denotes D. cabrerana specifically, distinguishing it from other DMT-bearing admixtures such as [[plants/psychotria-viridis]] and [[Mimosa hostilis]].  
- Expert practitioners note qualitative differences among admixtures, describing chaliponga-inclusive brews as possessing a characteristic visionary force at relatively modest leaf quantities, with variable somatic effects relative to other DMT sources[2][3][4].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Constituents:
- Leaves of B. rusbyana rank among the richer natural sources of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), with reported concentrations from approximately 0.17% to 1.74% by dry weight.  
- The plant also typically contains 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5‑MeO‑DMT) and minor tryptamines such as bufotenin, alongside trace amounts of N‑methyltetrahydro‑β‑carboline[3][4].  
- Early chemical investigations of “yajé” leaf admixtures used with B. caapi isolated both DMT and 5‑MeO‑DMT from materials attributed to this taxon[8].

Mechanism of action:
- DMT and 5‑MeO‑DMT are serotonergic psychedelics that act primarily as agonists at 5‑HT2A receptors in the central nervous system.  
- When prepared as [[preparations/ayahuasca]], B. caapi supplies β‑carbolines (harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine) that function as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), preventing first-pass metabolic degradation of DMT and rendering it orally active.  
- The pharmacodynamic interaction—5‑HT2A receptor engagement by tryptamines plus MAO‑A inhibition by β‑carbolines—yields a prolonged psychoactive experience suited to ritual and therapeutic aims in Amazonian practice[3][4][7].

Variability and context:
- Reported alkaloid levels vary with plant genetics, leaf age, harvest season, and preparation practices. Garden selection and clonal propagation likely contribute to persistent local chemotypes valued for specific ritual effects[2][3][4].  
- While 5‑MeO‑DMT has been detected in materials used as chaliponga, its presence and proportion can vary among samples; some admixture lots may contain primarily DMT with lower or undetectable 5‑MeO‑DMT[3][4][8].

Safety considerations:
- As with all MAOI-containing combinations, pharmacological interactions are nontrivial; traditional dietary and behavioral restrictions reflect long-standing empirical risk management within ceremonial contexts. Contemporary accounts caution that concomitant use of certain pharmaceuticals or substances can pose risks when MAO‑A is inhibited[2][3][4].  
- This ethnographic overview does not constitute medical guidance; ceremonial use historically occurs under guidance of experienced specialists.

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Harvesting:
- Practitioners collect mature leaves, often observing cultural protocols related to the plant’s perceived agency and to seasonal or lunar timing. Leaves are cleaned and sorted to remove senescent or damaged tissue[2][3][4].

Decoction:
- A common approach macerates and slowly boils approximately 3–8 leaves (equivalently reported as ~8–25 g dry material) together with sections of B. caapi vine. Preparation water is frequently acidified—often with citrus juice—to facilitate extraction. Decoction may proceed for several hours, with periodic reductions to concentrate the brew[3][4].  
- In some lineages, brews are clarified by settling and decantation, or held overnight between reductions, aiming for stability and a characteristic “shine” or “body” in the final liquid.  
- While the vine portion of B. rusbyana is occasionally referenced as a rare substitute for B. caapi in situations of scarcity or specific ritual intention, such use is exceptional; the leaves almost always serve in the admixture role[1].

Dosing and ceremonial administration:
- The quantity of chaliponga leaves is titrated by specialists according to participant experience, desired effect profile, and the potency of the vine. Smaller amounts are often sufficient relative to other DMT sources, with some practitioners reporting comparatively less nausea than with certain alternatives (e.g., [[Mimosa hostilis]])[3].  
- Administration occurs within formal ritual settings led by yagéceros or ayahuasqueros, incorporating diagnostic and therapeutic intentions, singing (icaros), and social-spiritual structuring of the experience through patterned sequences of calling, blowing, and cleansing[2][3][4].

Dietary and behavioral frameworks:
- Traditional dieta practices entail abstentions from salt, sugar, spices, alcohol, and sexual activity before and after ceremonies, with variations by region and lineage. Such frameworks align with both pharmacological prudence (e.g., MAOI interactions) and culturally specific etiologies of illness and healing[2][3][4].

Knowledge systems and evaluation:
- Efficacy and safety are construed through ethnomedical models that integrate visions, dreams, and bodily signs with plant spirits and cosmological relations. Apprenticeship emphasizes plant-by-plant discernment, including how chaliponga modifies the “voice” or “light” of the brew when combined with different types or preparations of B. caapi[2][3][4].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Status and pressures:
- Heightened global interest in ayahuasca has increased demand for both B. caapi and B. rusbyana. For chaliponga, patchy wild distribution, infrequent flowering, and dependence on vegetative propagation in many gardens raise concerns regarding genetic bottlenecks and local depletion if unmanaged harvesting expands[2][7].  
- Commercial seed offerings may be sporadic or of uncertain provenance, reflecting the species’ reproductive biology and the prevalence of clonal cultivation lines[7].

Stewardship strategies:
- Sustainable harvest and propagation: Support community-managed nurseries and agroforestry plots that prioritize local stewardship, intergenerational knowledge transmission, and selection for resilience alongside ritual qualities[2].  
- Genetic and ecological safeguarding: Encourage diversified plantings and maintenance of multiple lineages to mitigate genetic erosion; where feasible, complement garden stocks with carefully monitored wild stands to preserve ecological interactions and pollination processes.  
- Documentation and taxonomy: Promote accurate identification and voucher-backed documentation to reduce mislabeling and consequent biocultural and pharmacological risks, especially in trade and ex situ collections[1][2][5].  
- Research ethics and rights: Any research or bioprospecting should follow prior informed consent, equitable benefit-sharing, and recognition of Indigenous intellectual sovereignty, consistent with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol[2].

Community-defined priorities:
- Indigenous partners consistently articulate that cultural continuity—training new healers, maintaining ceremonial spaces, and safeguarding sacred varieties—forms the core of conservation. External collaborations should align with these priorities and avoid extractive dynamics[2][3][4].

Practical guidance for collections and gardens:
- Emphasize living collections sourced through ethical partnerships and documented lineage histories.  
- Maintain environmental conditions approximating humid, partially shaded forest-edge habitats with support structures for climbing, and schedule pruning/harvests to minimize stress and encourage vigorous regrowth.
