## Abstract
Banisteriopsis caapi var. caupuri (Caupuri Vine) represents a distinctive ethnobotanical lineage within Amazonian ayahuasca plant traditions. Recognized for its swollen stem nodes and perceived high potency, this Brazilian vine is valued by both Indigenous and regional religious practitioners for its intense visionary effects and pronounced purgative properties. Its ritual significance, preparation methods, chemical profile, and ongoing debates regarding taxonomy and conservation underscore its importance in Amazonian healing, spiritual, and biocultural contexts (Herbalistics n.d.[1]; ICEERS n.d.[4]; Chacruna 2023[3]). Emerging pharmacological work on B. caapi more broadly corroborates the central role of β-carboline alkaloids as reversible MAO-A inhibitors, while local folk classifications assign special potency to node-swollen forms such as Caupuri. As ayahuasca use globalizes, questions of sustainable cultivation, equitable benefit-sharing, and the protection of Indigenous knowledge systems remain pivotal (Labate & Jungaberle 2011[9]; Tupper 2009[10]).

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae  
- Clade: Angiosperms  
- Order: Malpighiales  
- Family: Malpighiaceae  
- Genus: Banisteriopsis  
- Species: Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C.V.Morton  
- Ethnobotanical variety: B. caapi var. caupuri (“Caupuri”) (Herbalistics n.d.[1]; Wikipedia n.d.[2]; NTBG n.d.[6])

Caupuri is an ethnovariety attributed to B. caapi rather than a formally recognized botanical variety under all taxonomic treatments. It is distinguished morphologically by enlarged, spherical to ovoid nodes along the stem—often compared to a rosary—within the broader phenotypic diversity attributed to more than 30 recognized ethnobotanical varieties used in ayahuasca traditions (Wikipedia n.d.[2]; Chacruna 2023[3]). Debate persists regarding whether some ethnovarieties warrant species-level status (e.g., B. inebrians) or are better considered intraspecific diversity within B. caapi (Chacruna 2023[3]).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
The Caupuri ethnovariety is reported primarily from equatorial regions of Brazil, within the wider native range of Banisteriopsis caapi across the western and central Amazon Basin (Herbalistics n.d.[1]; NTBG n.d.[6]; Wikipedia n.d.[2]). B. caapi is a perennial liana inhabiting lowland tropical rainforest, frequently climbing into the canopy and attaining lengths up to 30 meters. It thrives in humid, warm climates with ample rainfall and is commonly associated with secondary forest edges, riparian zones, and cultivated forest gardens where it can be trained on live supports.

Within Brazil, Caupuri is cultivated by Indigenous communities and by urban and peri-urban religious groups active in ayahuasca ceremonies. As ayahuasca practices have expanded, Caupuri cuttings have disseminated through informal networks, leading to a mosaic of ex situ plantings both within and beyond the Amazon. While cultivation outside its native range occurs, most ethnographic accounts emphasize Brazilian provenance and cultivation knowledge rooted in local ecologies and ceremonial practice (Herbalistics n.d.[1]; ICEERS n.d.[4]).

Environmental tolerances are consistent with B. caapi more generally: preference for filtered light when young, support for twining growth, and well-drained yet moisture-retentive soils typical of humid tropical forest conditions. Although hardy within tropical zones, B. caapi is sensitive to frost and prolonged drought. In community gardens, vines are often integrated into agroforestry systems where canopy structure and hydrology approximate forest conditions, thereby sustaining both plant vigor and cultural access (NTBG n.d.[6]; Wikipedia n.d.[2]).

## Ethnobotanical Context
Across the Amazon, B. caapi is revered as a “plant teacher” that facilitates learning, healing, divination, and social cohesion (ICEERS n.d.[4]). The Caupuri ethnovariety circulates in these traditions with a reputation for intensified visions and purgative effects. Indigenous peoples including Kaxinawa (Huni Kuin), Shipibo-Conibo, Ashaninka, and Tukano have long-standing traditions involving B. caapi, within which particular lineages—including Caupuri—may be selected for specific ritual aims based on morphology, perceived strength, and lineage history (ICEERS n.d.[4]; Chacruna 2023[3]).

In contemporary Brazil, ayahuasca practice extends to syncretic religious movements such as Santo Daime, União do Vegetal (UDV), and Barquinha. Within these contexts, Caupuri is sometimes singled out as a preferred vine for ceremonies oriented toward deep introspective work, bodily and emotional catharsis, and visionary instruction. Practitioners frequently emphasize the vine’s characteristic swollen nodes as a visible signifier of potency, integrating folk taxonomy with experiential assessments gathered over years of ceremonial use (Herbalistics n.d.[1]; Chacruna 2023[3]).

The attribution of “strength” to Caupuri is embedded in relational ontologies that join plant morphology, ritual craft, and community teaching lineages. The perceived purgative dimension—understood as cleansing at physical, emotional, and spiritual levels—features centrally in therapeutic narratives. These interpretations harmonize with broader Amazonian cosmologies in which plants possess agency and intentionality, and where visionary states facilitate diagnosis, guidance, and social repair (ICEERS n.d.[4]; Tupper 2009[10]).

Transmission of knowledge about Caupuri proceeds through oral teachings, apprenticeship with experienced ritual specialists, and observation across communal ceremonies. Urban religious institutions formalize aspects of this transmission through liturgical calendars, hierarchical roles, and codified norms, while Indigenous settings emphasize kinship-based pedagogy and territory-rooted stewardship. Recent collaborations between community experts, researchers, and NGOs have improved documentation and dialogue, though communities stress that scientific characterization should complement—not supplant—ancestral knowledge systems and rights (Chacruna 2023[3]; ICEERS n.d.[4]; Labate & Jungaberle 2011[9]).

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Like other B. caapi lineages, Caupuri contains β-carboline alkaloids, chiefly harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine (THH) (Herbalistics n.d.[1]; Wikipedia n.d.[2]; Morales-García et al. 2017[5]). These alkaloids act as reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitors (MAO-Ai), which in ceremonial admixtures enable the oral activity of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) contributed by companion plants such as [[Psychotria viridis]] (ICEERS n.d.[4]; Callaway 2001[8]). Harmine and harmaline provide the principal MAO-A inhibition, while THH has been reported to contribute serotonergic modulation through reuptake inhibition and other mechanisms, potentially shaping the qualitative profile of ayahuasca experiences (Morales-García et al. 2017[5]; Callaway 2001[8]).

Analytical studies of B. caapi indicate considerable chemotypic variability, reflecting genetic diversity, environmental conditions, plant age, and post-harvest handling (Morales-García et al. 2017[5]; ICEERS n.d.[4]). Within this variability, anecdotal observations and limited analyses suggest that Caupuri may present slightly elevated concentrations of harmala alkaloids relative to some other ethnovarieties, though available comparisons are not statistically robust and should be interpreted cautiously (Herbalistics n.d.[1]; Chacruna 2023[3]). The prominent node swelling in Caupuri, commonly taken as a sign of “strength,” is a culturally salient morphological marker; whether it correlates consistently with particular alkaloid ratios remains a subject for systematic study (Chacruna 2023[3]).

Beyond MAO-A inhibition, β-carbolines exhibit additional pharmacology of potential relevance to ritual effects and therapeutic research, including interactions with serotonin receptors, dopaminergic modulation, and neurogenic or neuroprotective properties reported in preclinical models (Morales-García et al. 2017[5]). These findings help contextualize practitioner reports that vine-forward brews (including Caupuri-only preparations) can produce somatic, cognitive, and affective shifts independent of added DMT sources. However, translating these mechanisms to ceremonial outcomes requires careful attention to set and setting, ritual structure, and the interpretive frameworks that guide meaning-making in Indigenous and syncretic traditions (ICEERS n.d.[4]; Tupper 2009[10]).

Safety considerations parallel those for ayahuasca generally. As MAO-A–modulating preparations, brews involving B. caapi can interact with medications or dietary amines; responsible practice emphasizes informed contraindication screening, patient consent in therapeutic contexts, and adherence to community guidelines (ICEERS n.d.[4]). Such protocols are part of ongoing efforts to bridge traditional knowledge with contemporary harm-reduction practices while preserving ceremonial integrity and authority.

## Traditional Preparation and Use
In Indigenous and religious settings, Caupuri vines are typically harvested, cleaned of bark residues as deemed appropriate by the tradition, and then decocted. Preparations may consist solely of the vine or be combined with leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]] (chacruna) or other regional admixtures, depending on ceremonial aims and lineage norms (NLNaturals n.d.[7]; ICEERS n.d.[4]). Within practitioner discourse, Caupuri is often favored for concentrated teas that are described as producing deep somatic purging and sustained visionary immersion; the swollen nodes are sometimes read as an index of potency and therefore selected with intentionality for particular works (Herbalistics n.d.[1]; Chacruna 2023[3]).

Ritual administration varies by community. In Indigenous contexts, nocturnal ceremonies may be held within communal houses or forest settings under the guidance of experienced specialists, with songs, icaros, or other forms of ritual speech mediating the visionary process. In Brazilian ayahuasca churches, administration occurs within structured liturgical formats—featuring hymns, collective seating or dance arrangements, and defined roles for facilitators—where the vine’s “force” is integrated into moral-educational frameworks characteristic of each doctrine (ICEERS n.d.[4]; Labate & Jungaberle 2011[9]).

Narratives surrounding Caupuri often foreground purging as a therapeutic mechanism, encompassing emesis and other forms of catharsis, framed as expulsion of physical impurities or psychospiritual burdens. Visionary content is interpreted through cosmologies that include plant spirits, ancestral guidance, and relational ethics. While some lineages value the vine as the primary teacher and brew it without additional plant admixtures, others combine Caupuri with DMT-containing leaves to emphasize visual phenomena and narrative clarity, tailoring the preparation to ceremonial goals (Herbalistics n.d.[1]; ICEERS n.d.[4]; Chacruna 2023[3]).

As interest in ayahuasca spreads, there is increasing emphasis on preserving ritual etiquette, preparation discipline, and the pedagogical pathways by which responsibility and authority are conferred. Communities underscore that access to plant materials should be accompanied by respect for place-based knowledge, protocols of reciprocity, and safeguarding of elders’ teachings that maintain the integrity of practice (Chacruna 2023[3]; Labate & Jungaberle 2011[9]).

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
The sustainability of B. caapi lineages, including Caupuri, faces pressures from increased demand, habitat alteration, and the commercialization of ayahuasca-related products. Overharvesting wild vines, the removal of mature lianas that function as seed sources, and extractive supply chains can undermine local ecologies and community access (ICEERS n.d.[4]). In response, many practitioners and organizations advocate for community-led cultivation, selective harvesting that allows regrowth, and integration of vines into agroforestry systems capable of meeting ceremonial needs while supporting biodiversity.

Biocultural ethics are central. Indigenous nations and traditional communities assert rights over their pharmacopoeias, ceremonial knowledge, and the terms of engagement with outside actors. Concerns about biopiracy and uncompensated appropriation—whether in the form of genetic materials, branding of ethnovarieties, or commodified narratives—prompt calls for equitable benefit-sharing, free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), and recognition of intellectual sovereignty over ritual forms and plant lineages (Chacruna 2023[3]; Tupper 2009[10]). Responsible research frameworks increasingly foreground community authorship and co-governance, ensuring that scientific inquiry proceeds in service to, and not at the expense of, traditional custodians.

Legal contexts vary internationally. In Brazil, the use of ayahuasca within recognized religious settings has been the subject of policy deliberations and cultural heritage debates, shaping how communities steward vines such as Caupuri and regulate ceremonial access (Labate & Jungaberle 2011[9]). In other jurisdictions, legal status is heterogeneous, prompting further emphasis on ethical travel, avoidance of extractive “ayahuasca tourism,” and support for local cultivation initiatives that reduce pressure on wild stocks. Transparency in sourcing and reinvestment in community projects are widely cited as practical expressions of reciprocity (ICEERS n.d.[4]).

As ethnopharmacological interest expands, conservation strategies benefit from integrating scientific monitoring—such as documenting chemotypic diversity—with Indigenous taxonomies that already organize vine selection and stewardship. Protecting the in situ cultural landscapes where Caupuri is embedded remains essential for sustaining both biological and cultural diversity over time (Chacruna 2023[3]; NTBG n.d.[6]).
