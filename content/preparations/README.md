# Preparations

This directory holds preparatory materials used by the site and contributors. Put content here that helps with planning, setup, checklists, and templates before publishing.

Recommended structure
- preparations/README.md (this file) — overview and guidelines
- preparations/checklists/ — checklist markdown files (e.g., publishing-checklist.md)
- preparations/templates/ — reusable content templates (e.g., post-template.md)
- preparations/assets/ — images or other assets used by preparatory documents

Guidelines
- Files should be plain Markdown (.md).
- Use YAML frontmatter where appropriate. Recommended frontmatter fields:
  - title: "Short, human-readable title"
  - date: YYYY-MM-DD
  - tags: [preparation, template]
  - draft: true/false
- Keep templates generic and well-documented so others can reuse them.

Example template frontmatter

If you'd like a specific checklist or template created in this folder (for example: "publishing-checklist.md" or "post-template.md"), tell me which file(s) to add and I will prepare them next.
