## Abstract
Banisteriopsis caapi var. caupuri (Caupuri Vine) is a culturally and pharmacologically significant variety of the ayahuasca vine, widely recognized by Amazonian healers and syncretic religious groups for its distinctive morphology and potent psychoactive properties. Noted for its swollen nodes and knotted stem, Caupuri is particularly esteemed for producing intense visionary experiences and deep somatic purging when prepared as ayahuasca, the entheogenic brew central to Amazonian medicinal and ceremonial traditions (Herbalistics; [1]). This article synthesizes current ethnobotanical, pharmacological, and anthropological knowledge concerning the Caupuri Vine, with an emphasis on its lineages, traditional preparations, social transmission, and associated biocultural considerations.

## Botanical Classification
Banisteriopsis caapi is a neotropical liana in the family Malpighiaceae, the same taxonomic group that includes several culturally important genera across the Neotropics ([2]; [5]). Within this species, Caupuri (also spelled “Kalpuri”) is a recognized ethno-variety that is not formally distinguished as a separate species in botanical nomenclature, but which is consistently identified by Indigenous, caboclo, and religious practitioners on morphological and experiential grounds ([4]). Across Amazonian ethnobotanical systems, more than 30 ethno-varieties of B. caapi are recognized—each associated with distinct ceremonial effects, lineages, and morphological traits ([4]).

- Family: Malpighiaceae  
- Genus: Banisteriopsis  
- Species: Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C.V.Morton  
- Variety (ethno-taxonomic): var. caupuri (“Caupuri” / “Kalpuri”)

Caupuri’s hallmark morphology includes a rope-like, knotted stem with conspicuously swollen nodes and a robust, gnarled appearance that distinguishes it from smoother-stemmed vines (Herbalistics; [1]). These features serve as field cues for selection by experienced harvesters, who often associate the pronounced nodal swellings with “strength” and ceremonial potency (Herbalistics; [1]; [4]). While some taxonomists have speculated that phenotypic heterogeneity might mask cryptic speciation or varietal-level differentiation, consensus remains that these are ethno-varieties maintained through cultural recognition, vegetative propagation, and lineage-based selection rather than formally recognized botanical taxa ([4]).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Banisteriopsis caapi is native to the Western and Central Amazon Basin, with distribution reported across Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and adjacent regions ([2]; [5]). It is cultivated widely beyond its primary range due to the expansion of ayahuasca practice and international horticulture ([2]). In situ, B. caapi typically occurs in lowland tropical rainforest habitats, climbing over support trees in secondary forest and forest margins. Cultivated stands are often established near communities, ceremonial centers, or along rivers, where managed patches facilitate sustainable harvest.

Caupuri, like other recognized ethno-varieties, is maintained within living collections by Indigenous and caboclo stewards, small-scale growers, and religious communities who propagate cuttings from valued lineages. These cultivation practices help maintain varietal traits across generations and landscapes, especially where phenotypic characteristics such as knotted nodes are selected for ritual efficacy and identity ([3]; [4]). Although rigorous ecological differentiation among B. caapi varieties has not been conclusively demonstrated, local experts sometimes associate Caupuri with particular microhabitats or soil conditions conducive to its robust growth and perceived potency ([4]). Ex situ cultivation in botanical gardens and private collections has also increased as part of broader conservation and research efforts ([7]).

## Ethnobotanical Context
Caupuri Vine holds a privileged place in Amazonian and Afro-Brazilian traditions that use ayahuasca for healing, divination, and religious ritual ([2]; [5]). Among Indigenous peoples—including Kaxinawá, Shipibo, and Guahibo—ayahuasca serves as a key medium for spiritual diagnosis, apprenticeship, social cohesion, and the treatment of physical and psychological ailments ([5]). Within these traditions, B. caapi is often conceptualized as a “plant teacher” whose spirit imparts knowledge, protection, and guidance; specific ethno-varieties such as Caupuri are selected for ceremonies matching their perceived temperaments and effects ([4]).

During the 20th century, B. caapi entered syncretic religious movements in Brazil, notably the União do Vegetal (UDV) and Santo Daime, where the sacrament—variously called hoasca or daime—became central to ritual life ([2]; [5]). Within these religious communities, different B. caapi varieties, including Caupuri, are recognized for distinctive effects, with Caupuri often regarded as exceptionally “strong,” conducive to deep purgation and compelling visionary depth (Herbalistics; [1]). This status integrates with cosmologies in which purgation is interpreted as a cleansing of bodily and spiritual impurities, enabling moral reflection and transformative insight ([5]).

Caboclo communities—descendants of Indigenous peoples and rubber tappers—play a vital role in stewarding wild and semi-wild stands of B. caapi, including Caupuri, and act as knowledge bearers, cultivators, and suppliers for ceremonial networks ([3]). Their ethnobotanical expertise encompasses site selection, propagation, harvest timing, and preparation, reflecting a mosaic of Indigenous, rural, and urban knowledge systems ([3]; [4]). In many localities, these communities mediate exchanges between forest and city, shaping the circulation of plants, recipes, and ritual practice.

Knowledge of Caupuri and its ritual uses is transmitted through oral tradition, apprenticeship, and intergenerational relationships within Indigenous, caboclo, and religious communities ([4]; [5]). This pedagogy includes careful attention to kinship between lineages of vines and human lineages of teachers; the reputations of particular Caupuri lines may be tied to renowned healers or communities, thereby reinforcing cultural continuity and identity ([4]). In recent decades, the expansion of ayahuasca practice beyond Amazonia—facilitated by religious movements, global interest, and ethnobotanical research—has reshaped how Caupuri knowledge is preserved and adapted, raising new questions about stewardship, access, and interpretation in transnational contexts ([2]; [5]). Cooperative replanting and community-based cultivation initiatives have emerged to support local supply, conserve preferred lines, and formalize sustainable practices amid rising demand ([3]).

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
The primary psychoactive constituents of B. caapi, including the Caupuri variety, are β-carboline alkaloids—harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine—that act predominantly as reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in the gut and central nervous system ([6]). By inhibiting MAO-A, these alkaloids allow orally ingested N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) from admixture plants to become bioavailable and psychoactive; however, B. caapi alone is psychoactive and is traditionally used as a purgative and visionary brew even in the absence of DMT admixtures ([6]).

Qualitative reports and vendor analyses suggest that Caupuri may contain relatively high concentrations of β-carbolines or an alkaloid profile associated with “strong” somatic and visionary effects compared to some other B. caapi varieties, though substantial inter-sample variability and methodological differences complicate definitive cross-varietal comparisons (Herbalistics; [1]). The subjective profile often attributed to Caupuri includes pronounced visual phenomena, deep somatic purging, and an emotionally intense, introspective phase—qualities sought by many ritual specialists for perceived cleansing and transformative efficacy (Herbalistics; [1]; [4]). At the neuropharmacological level, harmine and related β-carbolines have been investigated for potential neurogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antidepressant-like properties, which may contribute to the therapeutic dimensions reported in ceremonial settings ([6]).

In admixture-based ayahuasca, the synergy between B. caapi β-carbolines and DMT from companion plants such as [[Psychotria viridis]] (chacruna) or, in some traditions, [[Diplopterys cabrerana]] (chaliponga), underlies the characteristic visionary experience. The relative ratios of vine to leaf, the selection of Caupuri or other ethno-varieties, and the duration and temperature of decoction can shape the pharmacodynamic profile and somatic intensity of the brew ([2]; [6]). These parameters are typically adjusted by experienced preparers in light of ceremonial goals, participant needs, and local styles of practice ([5]).

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Traditional preparation of ayahuasca begins with harvesting mature segments of B. caapi Caupuri, typically selecting older, woody lianas associated with potency and respected lineages. The vine is macerated or pounded and combined with a DMT-rich admixture plant—most commonly [[Psychotria viridis]]—then slowly simmered for many hours to days until a concentrated decoction is obtained ([2]; [6]). Preparation is commonly ritualized: songs, prayers, and intentional silence are used to invite guidance from the plant spirits and to align the collective purpose of the ceremony ([5]). The brew is often clarified and reduced to a desired concentration, with aliquots reserved for subsequent ceremonies.

Notably, some ceremonialists prepare Caupuri-only decoctions, especially when seeking purgative or cleansing effects, as B. caapi by itself possesses notable emetic and psychoactive properties even in the absence of DMT admixture ([5]; [6]). In such contexts, the emphasis may be on physical and emotional release, dream incubation, and protection rather than fully elaborated visionary episodes. Where admixtures are used, the ratio of Caupuri to leaf is sometimes reduced relative to smoother-stemmed vines, reflecting the widespread attribution of “strength” to Caupuri and a desire to calibrate intensity to participant experience (Herbalistics; [1]).

Ceremonial significance is often attributed to Caupuri’s robust, knotted appearance, which some practitioners interpret as an embodied sign of ancestral lineage and potency (Herbalistics; [1]; [4]). The age of the vine, harvest timing, and the skilled hands of the preparer are viewed as critical to efficacy and spiritual depth; lineages of masters are remembered not only for their teaching and songs but also for their curatorial stewardship of particular vine lines ([4]). During ceremonies, purgation—through vomiting, sweating, crying, or other forms of release—is framed as a cleansing that can remove physical and spiritual “heaviness,” realign intention, and open visionary clarity ([5]). The interpretation of visions, songs (icaros or hinos), and collective dynamics varies by tradition, but the vine’s role as mediator between human communities and the spirit world is a recurrent theme ([5]).

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustainable harvest of Caupuri has become an increasing concern as global demand for ayahuasca has grown. Common ethical practices include leaving root systems intact, harvesting only sections of vine while allowing regrowth, and rotating collection sites to reduce pressure on wild stands ([3]). In many regions, cooperative cultivation and replanting programs have been developed by community groups, religious centers, and regional networks to ensure reliable local supply, preserve preferred lineages, and reduce incentives for unsustainable extraction ([3]; [4]). Community-based nurseries that propagate Caupuri from cuttings can help maintain characteristic traits while supporting livelihoods connected to traditional knowledge.

Biocultural rights are central to contemporary ethical discourse: documentation, commercialization, and distribution of B. caapi Caupuri should be conducted collaboratively with Indigenous and traditional communities, honoring protocols on consent, benefit-sharing, and cultural sovereignty ([4]; [5]). This includes transparent agreements about the movement of plant material, recognition of intellectual property embedded in lineages and preparation methods, and mechanisms that return tangible benefits to local stewards. In parallel, researchers and practitioners increasingly advocate for ethical frameworks that integrate Indigenous authority and spiritual significance into study design, data governance, and publication practices ([5]).

Regulatory environments remain heterogeneous and dynamic. While many Amazonian jurisdictions recognize traditional use, uncertainties persist regarding transport, international exchange of plant material, and the status of ayahuasca in non-Amazonian countries ([2]; [5]). These conditions can shape patterns of cultivation, conservation, and knowledge transmission, incentivizing local production for domestic use while complicating cross-border collaboration. Responsible actors seek alignment with local laws, community protocols, and conservation goals, emphasizing that the spiritual and cultural centrality of Caupuri is inseparable from the ecologies and communities that sustain it ([5]).

Given the cultural and ecological stakes, conservation of Caupuri entails more than preserving a genotype; it requires supporting the living systems of knowledge, ritual, and reciprocity that maintain the vine as a teacher plant. Integrative strategies—combining community-led cultivation, fair supply chains, and respectful research—offer promising paths to sustain both biological diversity and cultural vitality ([3]; [4]; [5]).
