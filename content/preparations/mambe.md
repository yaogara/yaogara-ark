# Mambe: The Sacred Coca Preparation of the Northwest Amazon

**Mambe** (also known as *ypadu*, *jíbie*, or *ipadu*) is a fine, vivid-green powder prepared from toasted coca leaves (*Erythroxylum coca* var. *ipadu*) mixed with alkaline plant ash, primarily from the yarumo tree (*Cecropia peltata* L. and related *Cecropia* species).  
It occupies a central place in the ceremonial and daily life of Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Amazon, including the Tukano, Uitoto (Witoto), Makuna, and Bora.  

Unlike refined cocaine, mambe represents a **traditional medicine and social integrator**, enabling extended nocturnal dialogues in the *maloca* (ceremonial house) where elders transmit ancestral knowledge.  
It functions as a **mild stimulant, cognitive enhancer, and spiritual conduit**, embodying cosmological principles of balance, thought, and word.

## 1 · Preparation Process

Mambe production involves drying and toasting coca leaves, pulverizing them, and blending the powder with alkaline ash from *Cecropia* species (yarumo) or other local plants such as *Pourouma cecropiifolia* or *Musa* spp.  
The ash, about one-third of the final mixture, provides essential alkalinity that facilitates alkaloid absorption and adds mineral nutrients.  
The resulting powder—bright green and sweetish—is stored dry in gourds, baskets, or metal tins.

Preparation varies by ethnic group, with each lineage maintaining specific ritual songs, ash recipes, and symbolic meanings transmitted through apprenticeship.

## 2 · Traditional and Ceremonial Use

Within the *maloca*, gatherings known as *mambeaderos* form the core of communal and spiritual life.  
Participants sit in dialogue through the night, consuming **mambe** together with **[ambil](./ambil.md)** (tobacco paste).  
Mambe represents *thought* and reflection; ambil represents *word* and expression—together forming the dual current of Amazonian cosmology.

These sessions transmit mythology, resolve conflicts, and reaffirm social harmony.  
Initiations, funerals, marriages, and healing ceremonies all incorporate mambe as a link between human and spirit worlds.

## 3 · Pharmacology and Effects

*Mambe* delivers coca alkaloids (0.2–0.5 % total), primarily cocaine in micro-doses along with ecgonine derivatives.  
Absorbed slowly through the oral mucosa, it produces sustained alertness and clear cognition without euphoria or crash.  
Cultural regulation and slow pharmacokinetics mean that traditional use shows **no evidence of dependence or toxicity**.

The alkaline ash maintains free-base alkaloid form, enhancing uptake while adding calcium, potassium, and phosphorus.

## 4 · Cultural Symbolism

Mambe embodies the feminine principle—coolness, patience, reflection—and balances ambil’s masculine, fiery aspect.  
It symbolizes **thought (*pensamiento*) and the true word (*palabra verdadera*)**, considered the creative force sustaining the world.  
Through its nightly ritual use, mambe becomes a material expression of speech, ethics, and ancestral lineage—an ecological philosophy of “living well” (*bien vivir*).

## 5 · Legal and Contemporary Context

Although the 1961 UN Single Convention classified coca leaf alongside cocaine, Indigenous rights frameworks (ILO 169, UNDRIP) affirm the legitimacy of traditional mambe use.  
Colombia’s Constitution and jurisprudence protect Indigenous coca practices, yet eradication policies continue to threaten them.  
Current WHO and UN reviews are reconsidering coca’s scheduling, recognizing its nutritional and medicinal value.  

Coca’s resurgence in intercultural contexts has prompted debates on respectful transmission, benefit-sharing, and protection of Indigenous intellectual property.
