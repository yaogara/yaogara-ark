## Abstract
Petiveria alliacea L., widely known as Anamu, is a perennial herb of the family Phytolaccaceae distributed across the tropical Americas. It is notable for its strong, garlic-like aroma and its dual status as a medicinal and ceremonial plant in Amazonian and adjacent cultural regions. Among Indigenous and mestizo groups, Anamu is used in energetic purification ([[limpieza]]) and for infections, fever, inflammation, and pain, with roots and aerial parts prepared as baths, washes, smudges, and short-course decoctions (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Bourdy et al. 2000; Rodrigues & Carlini 2005). Phytochemical studies identify sulfur-containing compounds—particularly dibenzyl trisulfide (DTS)—alongside flavonoids, phenolic acids, and volatile constituents; preclinical research reports antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and modest analgesic effects (Caceres et al. 1991; de Lemos et al. 1999; Williams et al. 2007; de Albuquerque et al. 2007). Although commonly occurring in disturbed and secondary habitats, increased market demand underscores the need for sustainable harvest, community-led cultivation, and ethical practices that respect biocultural rights and Free, Prior and Informed Consent (Heinrich et al. 1992; Ortiz et al. 2016).

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae  
- Family: Phytolaccaceae  
- Genus: Petiveria  
- Species: Petiveria alliacea L.

Petiveria alliacea is an herbaceous perennial, typically 0.5–1.5 m in height, with alternate, lanceolate leaves (approximately 10–20 cm long) and elongated, slender racemes bearing small white‑green flowers. The plant emits a pronounced alliaceous odor that intensifies when tissues are bruised or crushed, an organoleptic cue closely associated with its ceremonial and medicinal valuation (Smith-Hall et al. 2012; Ortiz et al. 2016). The root system is fibrous and distinctly aromatic. Morphologically, the plant exhibits an architecture conducive to repeated coppicing, allowing periodic harvest of leaves and stems without necessarily uprooting the specimen. Inflorescences are produced over long intervals in favorable conditions, supporting local seed set alongside vegetative propagation.

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Petiveria alliacea is native to the tropical and subtropical Americas, ranging from Mexico and the Caribbean south through Central America to northern South America, including the Amazon Basin (Heinrich et al. 1992). Within Amazonia, it is commonly reported from lowland forests and ecotonal margins, thriving in areas subject to disturbance such as secondary growth, fallows, forest edges, roadsides, and peri-urban zones (Smith-Hall et al. 2012; Ortiz et al. 2016). Its distribution mirrors anthropogenic patterns: where land is periodically cleared or opened to light, Anamu can establish and persist, often near settlements and agricultural plots.

Habitat preferences include:
- Light: partial shade to full sun, with robust growth in gaps and edges where diffuse light is available.
- Soils: a broad tolerance for well-drained to moderately moist soils, including loams and mixed alluvial substrates; plants are frequently observed in sites enriched by organic matter typical of secondary vegetation.
- Moisture: consistent rainfall regimes characteristic of humid tropical climates; local drought tolerance is facilitated by a perennial rootstock that resprouts with returning rains.

This ecological profile aligns with its ubiquity in ethnobotanical practice: proximity to human habitation and disturbed habitats facilitates ready access for ritual baths, topical washes, and decoction materials. The species’ tendency to colonize secondary habitats has contributed to its stable availability across many regions, though intensified commercial harvesting can exert localized pressure (Ortiz et al. 2016).

## Ethnobotanical Context
Across the western and central Amazon and into adjacent lowland regions, Petiveria alliacea is recognized in dual frameworks: as a plant of spiritual protection and cleansing and as a practical antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory remedy. Among Shuar, Kichwa, Shipibo-Conibo, and mestizo healers, Anamu is prepared for [[limpieza]] rituals—baths, smudges, or floor washes intended to dispel harmful influences, “mal aire,” or spiritual disharmony—often in conjunction with other aromatic allies such as Ruta graveolens and Ocimum spp. (Schultes & Raffauf 1990; Bourdy et al. 2000; Leonti et al. 2001). The pungent odor is interpreted as a sign of potency as well as an agent that “chases away” undesirable energies and pathogens (Bourdy et al. 2000).

Medicinally, leaves, stems, and roots are used in topical and internal preparations to address colds, fevers, skin and soft‑tissue infections, and inflammatory pain (Rodrigues & Carlini 2005). Decoctions of the root, considered stronger than leaf infusions, are administered in conservative, short courses under the guidance of healers, with attention to individual sensitivity, constitution, and concurrent conditions. In urban marketplaces, preparations labeled for “mal aire,” immune “support,” or general “purification” are widely traded, reflecting syncretic mestizo traditions that bridge ritual and medicinal practice.

Contemporary surveys indicate increased regional use in integrative and phytotherapeutic contexts in Peru, Brazil, Colombia, and Cuba, where Anamu occupies a liminal position between folk medicine and formal phytotherapy (Leonti et al. 2001). This diffusion is driven by the plant’s perceived efficacy, accessibility in secondary habitats, and ease of preparation in household settings. Its incorporation into syncretic ceremonies—including house cleansings, altar work, and offerings—extends to contexts such as [[despacho]] rituals in Andean-influenced practice, where aromatic plants are assembled to restore balance and protection.

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Petiveria alliacea contains a suite of bioactive compounds dominated by sulfur-containing organics, alongside phenolics and volatiles that contribute to its distinctive odor and bioactivity (de Lemos et al. 1999). Reported constituents and activities include:

- Dibenzyl trisulfide (DTS): A principal sulfur compound associated with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory actions; preclinical work suggests broad inhibition of microbial growth and effects on immune signaling pathways (Caceres et al. 1991; Williams et al. 2007).
- Flavonoids and phenolic acids: Contributing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and potential cytoprotective effects demonstrated in vitro, which may relate to topical uses for inflamed or infected tissues (de Albuquerque et al. 2007).
- Essential oils: Volatile components—including benzylated sulfides and related organosulfur molecules such as alliin-like compounds—are implicated in both olfactory potency and antimicrobial activity (de Lemos et al. 1999).
- Other constituents: Compounds such as astilbin and petivericin have been reported with immunomodulatory and cytotoxic effects in preclinical assays (Williams et al. 2007).

Antimicrobial and antifungal activity has been documented against organisms including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans, with mechanisms hypothesized to involve disruption of microbial membranes, interference with quorum sensing, and inhibition of energy metabolism (Caceres et al. 1991; de Lemos et al. 1999). Anti-inflammatory and modest analgesic effects observed in experimental models align with traditional uses for fever, rheumatic pains, and inflamed tissues (Rodrigues & Carlini 2005).

Safety, interactions, and evidence base:
- Safety profile: Traditional practitioners caution against prolonged internal use and advise conservative dosing due to gastrointestinal discomfort and hypersalivation reported with stronger preparations. Pregnant individuals are typically advised to avoid internal use given oxytocic signals in animal studies (Rodrigues & Carlini 2005).
- Drug–herb interactions: Comprehensive interaction data are limited. Preliminary reports suggest potential modulation—either potentiation or antagonism—of pharmaceuticals metabolized by hepatic CYP450 enzymes, underscoring the need for clinical pharmacokinetic studies and cautious co-administration (de Albuquerque et al. 2007).
- Evidence quality: The pharmacological literature for P. alliacea remains predominantly preclinical, with in vitro and in vivo studies providing mechanistic plausibility but limited controlled clinical data. As such, claims of efficacy should be framed within traditional use contexts and emerging research rather than established clinical consensus.

Together, these chemical and pharmacological profiles offer plausible pathways for the plant’s observed antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions in traditional practice while also contextualizing its ceremonial use grounded in pungent aromatics and sensory impact.

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Collection:
- Roots and aerial parts are generally wild-harvested during active growth. Healers often prefer mature individuals that exhibit a strong scent when bruised—an ethnosensory indicator of potency (Bourdy et al. 2000).
- Sustainable harvest emphasizes selective cutting of aerial parts and avoidance of complete uprooting when root material is not expressly required, thereby maintaining plant stands near households and along field margins.

Preparation modes:
- Energetic purification: Fresh leaves and roots are crushed and infused into cool or tepid water for ritual bathing, house smudging, or cleansing floor washes, often prepared immediately before use to preserve volatiles. In ceremonial settings, the plant may be included in aromatic bundles with Ruta graveolens and Ocimum spp. to reinforce protective boundaries during healing sessions (Leonti et al. 2001).
- Antimicrobial support: Roots—more rarely leaves—are decocted by boiling for roughly 10–20 minutes to produce a tea taken in short courses under guidance, tailored to constitution, symptom profile, and perceived strength of the material (Schultes & Raffauf 1990).
- Topical applications: Macerated leaves may be applied as poultices or incorporated into washes for localized infections and inflamed areas, consistent with reported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties (Bourdy et al. 2000; Rodrigues & Carlini 2005).

Ceremonial roles:
- Within [[limpieza]] practice, the plant’s strong odor is considered both a vehicle and sign of power; baths and smudges are performed to remove “heaviness,” “fright,” or “bad air.” In some syncretic contexts, Anamu is present in altar work and household protection, extending into [[despacho]]-type offerings where aromatic plants serve to re-balance social and ecological relations.
- The plant is commonly handled with prayer or sung invocations, especially in settings where illness is framed as both physiological and spiritual.

Adverse effects and contraindications:
- Reported effects include gastrointestinal discomfort and hypersalivation with concentrated preparations; internal use is generally limited in duration and avoided in pregnancy (Rodrigues & Carlini 2005).
- Given preliminary indications of CYP450 involvement, practitioners advise caution when users are taking narrow-therapeutic-index medications (de Albuquerque et al. 2007).

Storage and handling:
- Because volatile constituents contribute to both ritual and medicinal functions, preparations are often made fresh. Dried material may be stored for decoctions, but healers typically prioritize olfactory assessment to gauge quality prior to use.

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability and cultivation:
- Ecological status: Petiveria alliacea commonly occurs in disturbed and secondary habitats; at present, wild harvesting is generally not considered a major conservation concern across much of its range (Smith-Hall et al. 2012; Ortiz et al. 2016). Nevertheless, expanding commercial and export demand can create localized pressure points.
- Harvest protocols: To sustain local populations, selective pruning of aerial parts and rotational harvesting are preferable to whole-root removal, except where roots are specifically needed in small quantities. Maintaining seed-bearing individuals within harvesting areas supports natural regeneration.
- Propagation: The species can be propagated via seed and root cuttings, permitting household and community gardens to reduce pressure on wild stands and generate local income streams aligned with traditional stewardship (Heinrich et al. 1992). Community-led nurseries can also ensure traceable supply and quality control.

Quality, safety, and market dynamics:
- Market presence in urban centers has grown, increasing the need for correct identification, avoidance of adulterants, and transparent chain-of-custody. Local cooperatives can implement simple quality standards—organoleptic checks, batch labeling, and documentation of harvest sites—to safeguard users and honor source communities.
- As cultivated material enters markets, participatory protocols can help align production schedules with ritual calendars and community priorities, ensuring that monetization does not displace ceremonial availability.

Cultural rights and research ethics:
- Respect for Indigenous intellectual property and plant knowledge is paramount. Ethical ethnobotanical work requires Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), ongoing community governance of research agendas, and equitable benefit-sharing where pharmacological derivatives or commercial products are pursued (Convention on Biological Diversity 1992).
- Documentation and dissemination should acknowledge language, histories, and customary law of source communities. Where plant use is embedded in ceremonial frameworks, researchers and clinicians are urged to avoid decontextualization that extracts bioactivity from its relational meanings.
- Cross-sector collaborations—between community healers, botanists, and clinicians—can advance safety and efficacy evidence while reinforcing biocultural sovereignty and local livelihoods.

Policy and future research:
- Regional pharmacopeias and integrative health systems increasingly reference Anamu; harmonized policies can support safe use by standardizing labeling and contraindications while safeguarding traditional access.
- Priority research includes clinical evaluation of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory indications, pharmacokinetic studies to clarify CYP450 interactions, and long-term ecological monitoring to track effects of scaled cultivation and trade (Leonti et al. 2001; Ortiz et al. 2016).
