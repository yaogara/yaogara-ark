## Abstract
Cyperus prolixus, commonly referenced in Amazonian ethnobotanical literature as “Toé Root” or “Ajos Sacha alt.,” is a Cyperaceae sedge native to moist ecosystems of the western Amazon basin (Odonne et al. 2013). It holds cultural and medicinal value among Indigenous and mestizo communities, particularly through its use in floral baths, vaporations, and protective rituals. Reported applications emphasize clarity of mind and protection against negative influences, alongside pharmacological use for diarrhea and digestive disturbances (Odonne et al. 2013; Rocha 2014). Although direct phytochemical studies on C. prolixus remain limited, analogous Cyperus taxa contain sesquiterpenes, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory potential (Mesquita and Tavares-Mastins 2018; Hajdu and Hohmann 2012). This article synthesizes the available ethnobotanical and pharmacological scholarship, outlines traditional preparations, and situates the species within contemporary conservation and ethical frameworks.

## Botanical Classification
- Family: Cyperaceae  
- Genus: Cyperus  
- Species: Cyperus prolixus Kunth

Morphology:  
Cyperus prolixus is a perennial sedge with slender, erect, three-angled culms typically 30–90 cm in height. Leaves are mostly basal, with narrow, linear blades. Inflorescences consist of spikelet clusters borne on umbel-like arrangements subtended by leaf-like bracts; spikelets are relatively small and can appear inconspicuous within dense riparian vegetation (Kukkonen 2020; Odonne et al. 2013). Rhizomatous growth facilitates local persistence and patch expansion in wet soils, allowing the plant to re-sprout following seasonal fluctuations in water availability. As in many Cyperus species, reduction in leaf surface and prevalence of aerenchyma contribute to tolerance of periodic inundation and poor oxygenation in saturated substrates. Diagnostic identification relies on spikelet and glume morphology, inflorescence architecture, and culm cross-section, and should be based on regional floras or specialist keys (Kukkonen 2020).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Cyperus prolixus is native to the upper and mid-Amazon basin, recorded most frequently in Peru and Colombia with occurrences in bordering regions of Brazil (Odonne et al. 2013; Mesquita and Tavares-Mastins 2018). It favors moist, open habitats along rivers, streams, floodplain margins, and other seasonally wet ground. These riparian ecotones present fluctuating hydrologic regimes that select for sedge assemblages; C. prolixus occupies microsites with sufficient light where disturbance maintains open patches against woody encroachment. The species is commonly encountered in anthropogenic landscapes as well, including paths, clearings, and peridomestic zones where water collects, reflecting the adaptive generalism of Cyperaceae in human-modified environments (Odonne et al. 2013; Mesquita and Tavares-Mastins 2018).

Cultivation and near-domestication practices extend its distribution beyond strictly wild habitats. Ethnobotanical surveys report the presence of C. prolixus in Amazonian home gardens and managed forest plots, systems that function as reservoirs of medicinal plants and facilitate ready access for household healthcare (Carniello et al. 2010). In such agroforestry mosaics, the sedge may be deliberately tolerated or transplanted to wet corners of yards, irrigation channels, or vessel-stored water for later use in decoctions and baths. The ease of vegetative spread and moderate shade tolerance support its persistence in these semi-cultivated contexts.

## Ethnobotanical Context
Traditional Uses:  
Among Shipibo-Konibo, Kukama-Kukamiria, and various mestizo herbalists, C. prolixus is primarily valued for its role in floral baths (baños de florecimiento) and vaporations (steamed inhalations) employed to promote protection, clarity, and the dispelling of negative energies (Rocha 2014; Freitas 2014). In medicinal contexts, roots and aerial parts are used in household remedies, including as a chewed or crushed adjuvant for digestive complaints such as diarrhea (Odonne et al. 2013). These uses emphasize gentle topical and aromatic applications that align with broader Amazonian hygiene and ritual bathing traditions, where scent, temperature, and plant synergy are key and where preparations are often conducted at dawn to maximize perceived efficacy (Rocha 2014).

Ritual and Symbolic Functions:  
C. prolixus is widely framed as a protective plant associated with shamanic and household protection practices. It is included as an amulet plant to deter “evil eye,” mala energía, and other perceived spiritual disturbances, reflecting a moral-energetic model of illness consistent with Amazonian cosmologies (Rocha 2014). In these contexts, healers may blend C. prolixus with complementary aromatic species to “refresh” the body, re-establish clarity, and cleanse interpersonal or environmental influences. The knowledge of timing, prayer, song, and ritual sequencing resides with specialists and elders; learning occurs through observation, apprenticeship, and household instruction (Freitas 2014).

Contemporary Uses and Transmission:  
In urban and peri-urban settings, mestizo curanderos and herbalists continue to employ C. prolixus in integrative health approaches, pairing it with other aromatic sedges and herbs in topical and aromatic formulae (RS&D Journal 2022). Transmission remains primarily oral—recipes, sourcing practices, and ritual frameworks are seldom systematized in written form—though recent documentation efforts and community collaborations have increased visibility of these practices and contributed to cross-cultural exchange (Freitas 2014). This evolving landscape underscores the plant’s continued relevance in contemporary Amazonian ethnomedicine, bridging household care, spiritual hygiene, and professional healing (Rocha 2014; RS&D Journal 2022).

Cautions on Nomenclature and Identification:  
Regional names such as “toé” and “ajos sacha” may refer to multiple taxa depending on locality and vendor practice. Accurate identification is essential to avoid confusion with other species that may be pharmacologically distinct. Reliance on botanical characters, herbarium voucher comparisons, and guidance from experienced practitioners is recommended when sourcing material for research or use (Kukkonen 2020).

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Principal Active Compounds:  
Targeted phytochemical studies of C. prolixus are limited; however, analogous Cyperus species contain sesquiterpenes, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds, chemical classes broadly associated with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities (Mesquita and Tavares-Mastins 2018; Hajdu and Hohmann 2012). Such metabolites contribute to the aromatic profile considered important in ritual baths and vaporations and may underpin topical soothing effects reported by practitioners. Within Cyperus more generally, volatile oils and phenolics often co-occur, providing both olfactory cues and bioactivity across multiple preparation modes (Mesquita and Tavares-Mastins 2018).

Mechanisms of Action:  
Reported antidiarrheal effects are plausibly linked to astringent and antimicrobial activities of terpenoids and polyphenols that may modulate gut motility, reduce intestinal secretions, or inhibit microbial growth associated with nonspecific diarrhea (Odonne et al. 2013; Mesquita and Tavares-Mastins 2018). In topical and aromatic applications, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects could contribute to perceived “clarifying” or “cooling” outcomes, consistent with Indigenous explanatory models of heat, wind, and energetic hygiene (Rocha 2014). Some Cyperus species exhibit central nervous system-modulating effects in experimental settings; however, direct evidence for C. prolixus remains insufficient and warrants focused pharmacological study to distinguish species-specific bioactivity from family-level generalizations (Hajdu and Hohmann 2012).

Safety and Interactions:  
Traditional preparations are primarily topical and aromatic, suggesting limited systemic exposure relative to internal dosing. Nonetheless, oral uses for digestive complaints imply potential pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions with pharmaceuticals, particularly agents affecting gut motility, electrolyte balance, or the microbiota. Prudence dictates avoiding concurrent administration with antidiarrheals or antimicrobials without clinical guidance, and monitoring for dehydration or electrolyte disturbances during acute diarrhea (Hajdu and Hohmann 2012). As with all sedge-derived remedies, variability in chemotype, harvest timing, and preparation can influence potency; practitioners rely on sensory evaluation and lineage-based protocols to calibrate dosing (Freitas 2014).

Research Gaps:  
Key priorities include: (1) voucher-based phytochemical profiling of C. prolixus across habitats; (2) antimicrobial and antidiarrheal assays aligned with traditional preparation modes; (3) safety evaluations for oral use, including genotoxicity and herb–drug interaction screens; and (4) ethnographic documentation of preparation protocols to support replicability and culturally grounded interpretation (Odonne et al. 2013; Mesquita and Tavares-Mastins 2018; Hajdu and Hohmann 2012).

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Collection and Handling:  
Plants are harvested from the wild or home-garden plots, with root and aerial parts collected depending on intended use (Carniello et al. 2010; Odonne et al. 2013). Material is typically gathered at dawn or in the cool of morning, when aromatic intensity is considered optimal. Roots are rinsed to remove sediments, then trimmed for immediate use or short-term storage in cool water. As with many ritual plants, practitioners may observe abstentions or prayers during collection, aligning the act of harvesting with the intended protective or clarifying purpose (Rocha 2014; Freitas 2014).

Preparation Methods:
- Floral Baths: Fresh or lightly macerated roots and leaves are infused in cool or warmed water, often with companion aromatics. The decoction is poured over the head and body, typically during morning or ritual sessions, while the practitioner sings or prays to direct the action toward protection, clarity, and removal of mala energía (Rocha 2014). The residual plant material may be left at a crossroads, river, or designated disposal place to “carry away” negativity.
- Vaporations: Plant material is layered into heated water to generate steam; the recipient inhales vapors under a cloth or in a small enclosed space. Sessions are brief and repeated as needed to clear “bad air,” ease head congestion, and restore mental clarity. Vaporations are sometimes combined with gentle skin rubs using the same infusion to reinforce the aromatic effect.
- Oral/Topical Use: For digestive complaints, roots may be chewed directly, crushed, or brewed as a tea for short-term use, often combined with bland dietary measures. For protective applications, small bundles of leaves and roots can be carried as amulets or hung near doorways. Oral administration is conservative in dose and duration and typically reserved for acute, self-limiting symptoms (Odonne et al. 2013; Rocha 2014).

Ceremonial Roles and Synergy:  
C. prolixus is seldom the sole focus of ritual. Rather, it functions as a supporting plant within protective and clarifying sets that may include aromatics such as [[Mansoa alliacea]] and invigorating leaves such as [[plants/ilex-guayusa]], calibrated by the healer to the person and circumstance. The perceived synergy resides in complementary scent profiles, temperature qualities, and ritual intentions, with dosing guided by lineage knowledge and the practitioner’s assessment at the time of treatment (Freitas 2014). The plant’s modest intrinsic potency and topical emphasis make it suitable for household-level care, while still participating in formal curanderismo contexts shaped by prayer, song, and smoke (Rocha 2014; RS&D Journal 2022).

Quality Control and Identification:  
Because common names overlap across taxa, selection is often guided by morphology, scent, and community consensus. Healers may use sensory criteria—aroma intensity, freshness, and “clean” mouthfeel of expressed sap—to judge suitability. Field identification can be supported by noting the characteristic sedge culm, basal leaves, and spikelet-bearing inflorescences (Kukkonen 2020). When in doubt, deference to experienced collectors or reliance on garden-sourced material of known provenance reduces misidentification risks.

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustainability:  
C. prolixus is not currently considered endangered; populations are robust in many riparian zones and anthropogenic habitats (Carniello et al. 2010). Its sedge life history—clonal spread, tolerance of disturbance, and preference for wet microsites—supports resilience under moderate harvesting. Nonetheless, escalating interest in Amazonian medicinal flora can generate localized pressure, habitat disturbance, and market-driven extraction. Low-impact harvesting protocols, rotation of collection sites, and preference for home-garden sourcing are consistent with both ecological sustainability and community practice (Carniello et al. 2010).

Cultivation and Access:  
Home-garden and managed-plot cultivation maintain accessibility for rural and peri-urban populations, buffering supply during seasonal scarcity and reducing pressure on wild stands (Carniello et al. 2010). Community-led nurseries and seed/propagule exchanges foster resilience of traditional pharmacopoeias and enable youth engagement in plant care and knowledge transfer.

Cultural Rights and Research Ethics:  
Ethical engagement with communities that steward C. prolixus knowledge requires informed consent, recognition of community intellectual property, and equitable benefit-sharing in any documentation or commercialization pathway. Respect for oral transmission and ritual context is essential; researchers and practitioners should adhere to locally defined protocols for recording, publishing, and applying knowledge (Goés et al. 2019; RS&D Journal 2022). Collaborative research—co-designed with knowledge holders—supports both scientific rigor and cultural integrity, ensuring that pharmacological inquiry does not abstract remedies from the social and spiritual frameworks that give them meaning (Freitas 2014; Rocha 2014).

Public Health Interfaces:  
As interest grows among non-local users, guidance should emphasize correct identification, conservative dosing, and deference to trained practitioners, particularly when translating practices like vaporations and floral baths into novel settings. Public-facing materials benefit from clear, non-extractive language and avoidance of clinical overreach where evidence remains preliminary (Hajdu and Hohmann 2012; RS&D Journal 2022).
