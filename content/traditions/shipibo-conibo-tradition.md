## Abstract
The Shipibo-Conibo, originating from the Ucayali River region of the Peruvian Amazon, maintain a robust visionary healing tradition centered on the ceremonial use of ayahuasca and other teacher plants (plantas maestras) accompanied by elaborate songs (ikaros) and plant diets (dietas)[1][3][6]. The Shipibo shamanic lineage, known for its rigorous apprenticeships and medicinal knowledge, constitutes a dynamic and living interface between Indigenous epistemologies, forest biodiversity, and the sociocultural challenges of modernity. Their healing system integrates pharmacological synergy—most notably the β-carboline alkaloids of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and the DMT-containing leaves of [[Psychotria viridis]]—with complex social, musical, and aesthetic technologies that translate visionary knowledge into therapeutic practice[4][7]. The present overview synthesizes ethnographic, ritual, and pedagogical frameworks underpinning Shipibo-Conibo ceremony, emphasizing intergenerational continuity, the transmission of healing lineages, and current issues in conservation, governance, and cultural sovereignty[2][3][6]. As Shipibo healers increasingly engage global publics, questions of ethical engagement, intellectual property, and sustainable resource use have become central to the future of this living tradition[3][4][6].

## Botanical Classification
Although not a plant taxon, the Shipibo-Conibo tradition is inseparable from specific teacher plants and from a coherent ethnolinguistic identity that frames their medical practice.

- Ethnolinguistic affiliation: Shipibo-Conibo (also Shipibo-Konibo), an Indigenous people of the Panoan linguistic family in eastern Peru[2][10]. Historically distinguished as Shipibo and Konibo, the groups intermarried extensively and consolidated culturally, sharing ritual, artistic, and medical lifeways[2].
- Core teacher plants within Shipibo practice:
  - Ayahuasca vine: [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] (Shipibo: oni caapi), source of β-carboline alkaloids central to the brew’s pharmacology[4][7].
  - Admixture leaf: [[Psychotria viridis]] (Shipibo: chacruna), a source of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), variably combined with the vine[4][7].
- Ritual media and knowledge forms:
  - Ikaros: medicine songs learned through dietas and visions, serving diagnostic, protective, and therapeutic roles[1][6][8].
  - Kené: geometric designs rendered in textiles and ceramics, viewed as visual correlates of song and plant spirit communication[2][8].
- Healers (onanya): ritual specialists whose training involves prolonged plant dietas, strict abstinence, and apprenticeship within family-based lineages[1][5][6][9].

This constellation of plants, songs, and designs constitutes an integrated “medical cosmology” in which botanical materials, linguistic performance, and visual patterning mutually reinforce therapeutic effect[1][2][6][8].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
The Shipibo-Conibo inhabit the Ucayali River basin and its tributaries in eastern Peru, a region encompassing extensive floodplains, oxbow lakes, gallery forests, and terra firme rainforest[2][10]. Traditional settlements developed along navigable rivers, enabling seasonal mobility, fishing, swidden horticulture, and access to diverse medicinal and ritual plant ecologies. Riverine environments provide both subsistence and the botanical diversity foundational to the Shipibo pharmacopoeia, including mature lianas of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and shade-tolerant admixture species[2][3][10].

In the contemporary period, Shipibo communities maintain a mixed settlement pattern. Many continue to reside in ancestral villages distributed along the Ucayali and its tributaries, while others have migrated to peri-urban areas such as Pucallpa and its environs in search of schooling, health services, and market access[2][3]. This mobility has reshaped ritual life: some ceremonies take place in traditional malokas within forest communities; others are conducted in community-owned centers near towns, or in intercultural contexts involving visiting patients and apprentices from Peru and abroad[3][6][7].

Ongoing environmental pressures—deforestation, land-use change, logging, and extractive economies—affect the ecological availability of key teacher plants and the livelihoods that sustain ceremonial practice[3][4]. In response, Shipibo-led conservation efforts emphasize territorial defense, community nurseries, and the replanting and stewardship of ritual species, alongside the reinforcement of traditional knowledge transmission within youth programs[3][4][10].

## Ethnobotanical Context
The Shipibo-Conibo are internationally recognized for a sophisticated plant medicine healing system with ayahuasca (oni) as keystone in therapeutic, divinatory, and communal exchanges[1][3][7]. Healers, or onanya, diagnose and treat illness understood as simultaneously physiological, social, and spiritual. Ceremonial work typically unfolds at night and centers on the ikaro, a sung invocation by which the healer channels the powers of specific plants, protective spirits, and ancestral lineages to effect cleansing, alignment, and restoration[1][6][8].

Learning medicine entails a demanding apprenticeship framework. Aspirants undertake plant dietas—extended periods of ingesting preparations from designated plantas maestras under strict protocols of isolation and abstinence—through which they cultivate relationships with plant spirits, acquire songs, and master techniques of diagnosis and protection[1][5][6][9]. Such dietas are not solely preparatory; patients also undertake shorter dietas as part of treatment, with individual plants selected to address particular conditions or intentions[5][9].

Visionary, musical, and visual modes of knowledge reinforce one another. Kené designs, rendered in textiles, beadwork, and ceramics, are said to correspond to the geometric architectures perceived in visions and to the sonic pathways of the ikaros[2][8]. In this view, patterns are not merely decorative but are communicative, protective, and pedagogical, inscribed both upon the body (through painted designs and garments) and within the ceremonial space[2][8]. Everyday artistry thus encodes healing knowledge and contributes to the durability of tradition through intergenerational craftwork.

As Shipibo healers interface with global audiences—tourist shamanism, retreat centers, academic collaborations—they navigate complex economies of exchange and representation[3][4][6][7][8]. While visibility has amplified respect for Shipibo medical expertise, it has also introduced risks of commodification, misrepresentation, and dilution of protocols. Nonetheless, many Shipibo-led initiatives foreground community control, ethical pedagogy, and cultural continuity, including the rising public presence of female healers (onanya ainbo), who have long contributed to healing but whose leadership is now more widely acknowledged[6].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Pharmacologically, Shipibo ayahuasca draws on the synergy between the β-carboline alkaloids of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]]—principally harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine—and the tryptamine N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) present in admixtures such as [[Psychotria viridis]][4][7]. The β-carbolines act as reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), allowing orally ingested DMT to become psychoactive by preventing its rapid degradation in the gut and liver. Tetrahydroharmine may additionally modulate serotonergic systems through mild serotonin reuptake inhibition, while harmine and harmaline influence cortical oscillations and autonomic responses, contributing to the brew’s visionary, introspective, and emetic properties[4][7].

In Shipibo ceremony, pharmacology is nested within ritual technologies. The timing of ingestion, the sequencing and targeting of ikaros, the blowing of tobacco smoke (soplada), and the use of aromatic plants are understood to guide visions, clarify diagnostic perception, and modulate the somatic and emotional trajectory of the night[1][6][8]. Emetic purging is interpreted as the expulsion of pathogenic influences and energetic residues, not merely a side effect. Healers tailor songs to individual patients, “calling” specific plant powers to address particular ailments or to neutralize perceived intrusions. Thus, pharmacodynamics and ritual form are co-constitutive: the plants open visionary perception; songs structure it; designs stabilize and extend it into material culture[1][6][8].

While many Shipibo brews focus on the vine and chacruna leaf, admixture composition can vary by healer, lineage, and ecological availability. Variability is part of the art: onanya calibrate the brew’s β-carboline-to-tryptamine balance to the needs of the group, the season, and the ceremonial intention[4][7]. This pharmacological plasticity is anchored by strict ritual ethics and a pedagogy that emphasizes disciplined dietas, humility before plant teachers, and the primacy of song[1][5][6].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Preparation of the ayahuasca brew involves synergistic combinations of [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] vine with admixture plants such as [[Psychotria viridis]] (chacruna), which contains the psychoactive alkaloid DMT[4][7]. Ritual procedure is highly codified:

- Setting: Nighttime ceremonies are typically held in communal malokas (ceremonial spaces), orchestrated by one or more experienced healers[5][6]. The space is prepared with protective songs, aromatic plants, and sometimes mapacho tobacco, with participants seated in a circle to facilitate individual attention and collective cohesion[1][6][8].
- Plant Dietas: Apprentices or patients engage in diets (dietas) with specific teacher plants—ingesting prescribed plant extracts or teas under strict protocols of food, social, and often sexual abstinence, designed to foster a non-ordinary relationship with the plant spirit[5][9]. Dieta restrictions commonly limit salt, sugar, alcohol, pork, and spicy foods, and emphasize solitude, rest, and attentiveness to dreams and songs[5][9].
- Ikaro: The ritual core, where the healer “calls” or channels the healing power of plants through sung ikaros, often individualized to address particular illnesses or intentions[1][6][8]. Ikaros may be whistled or sung, directed to the group or “blown into” individuals through breath and smoke (soplada). Healers modulate tempo, melody, and lyrical content to guide visionary states, stabilize emotions, and enact protections against harmful influences[1][6][8].
- Diagnosis and Treatment: Through visions, tactile diagnostics, and musical “scanning,” onanya perceive dissonances in a patient’s energetic and bodily state. Treatment may include the extraction of perceived intrusions, strengthening with protective songs, and the administration of non-ayahuasca remedies (ointments, baths, plant teas) aligned with dietas[1][6][8][9].
- Integration: Post-ceremonial debriefings, restrictions (post-dieta taboos), and community care contribute to the safe and effective integration of visions and healing outcomes[1][9]. Guidance often continues between ceremonies, with attention to dreams, bodily changes, and the progressive learning of plant songs by apprentices.

The ceremonial process interlaces sensoria: light discipline (often darkness), olfactory cues from resins and plants, tactile rhythm from a leaf-bundle rattle (shacapa), and the patterned geometry of kené garments and textiles that visually anchor the space[2][8]. Each dimension scaffolds attention and memory, enabling the transmission of complex medicinal knowledge across nights, seasons, and generations.

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Shipibo healing depends on sustained access to rainforest biodiversity and to the territories that anchor cultural life[3][4]. Accelerating deforestation, illegal land sales, extractive industries, and the commodification of ayahuasca for foreign markets present existential threats to cultural and ecological continuity[3][4]. Community-led responses include reforestation of ritual species, seed and cutting exchanges among lineages, youth-focused cultural education, and the consolidation of territorial claims through Indigenous federations and legal advocacy[3][4][10].

Ethical research and respectful engagement demand:
- Recognition of Shipibo intellectual property and co-authorship in ethnobotanical documentation, including rights associated with ikaros, kené, and ritual protocols[3][4][8].
- Support for biocultural rights and the principles of free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC), aligning with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples[3][4].
- Fair compensation and benefit-sharing with Shipibo communities for teaching, healing, and artistic work, with transparent governance and community oversight[3][4][6][7].
- Safeguards against cultural appropriation, extractive tourism, and misrepresentation of Shipibo medicine in commercial contexts[3][4][6][7].
- Ecological stewardship of key teacher plants through cultivation, protection of mature stands, and habitat restoration, reducing pressure on wild populations while maintaining lineage-specific practices[3][4].

As Shipibo healers continue to share their medicine beyond the Ucayali, partnerships that center Shipibo authority, prioritize ecological regeneration, and reinforce traditional pedagogy offer viable pathways for continuity. The future of the tradition hinges on the co-evolution of cultural sovereignty, forest stewardship, and ethical intercultural exchange[3][4][6][10].
