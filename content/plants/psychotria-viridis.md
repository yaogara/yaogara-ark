## Abstract
Psychotria viridis (Chacruna) is a tropical Amazonian shrub of foundational importance in Indigenous pharmacology, primarily for its role as the key source of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in the psychoactive brew [[preparations/ayahuasca]]. Among Amazonian groups, it is valued as a "teacher plant," integral to ceremonial healing, divination, and cultural identity. Its pharmacology is unique for providing an orally active entheogenic experience when combined with [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]], which supplies monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Contemporary research addresses not only its complex cultural uses but also issues of conservation, cultivation, and biocultural rights.

## Botanical Classification
- Family: Rubiaceae  
- Genus: Psychotria  
- Species: Psychotria viridis Ruiz & Pavón  
- Common names: Chacruna (Quechua: chacruna, chacrona, chaqruy)

Morphology:
- P. viridis is a perennial shrub to small tree, usually up to 5 m tall with shiny, elliptic leaves (up to 15 cm × 6 cm), opposite arrangement, glabrous surface above, and pilose veins beneath [1][5].
- Inflorescences are terminal with clusters of white flowers; fruits are purple-red when ripe [1][5].

Taxonomically, P. viridis belongs to a large, pantropical genus that includes many understory shrubs. Among Indigenous Amazonian classifications, the plant is often distinguished into local types by subtle morphological and sensory cues (leaf size, sheen, venation, perceived strength), reflecting fine-grained ethnobotanical knowledge [4][7]. These emic typologies can guide selection for specific ceremonial purposes, and they coexist with scientific classification systems without necessarily mapping directly onto them.

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Native to the western and central Amazon basin, Psychotria viridis is reported from Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, where it thrives in humid tropical forests [7]. Herbarium and field records indicate a preference for lowland rainforest conditions with high rainfall and stable humidity, although the species may also persist in secondary growth, riverine edges, and forest gaps where diffuse light penetrates the canopy [1][7].

- Natural distribution: Amazon basin—Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia—primarily in humid tropical forest environments [7].  
- Habitat preferences: partial shade to filtered light in the understory; well-drained, organic-rich soils; consistently warm temperatures; high atmospheric humidity [1][6][7].  
- Growth form and ecology: as an understory shrub, P. viridis maintains broad, glossy leaves adapted to lower light levels, with reproductive phases (flowering/fruiting) tracking local seasonal dynamics. Fruits are attractive to birds, which likely contribute to regional seed dispersal; vegetative propagation through stem cuttings also contributes to persistence in anthropogenic settings [1][6].

In areas with long-standing human occupation, P. viridis frequently occurs in culturally modified forest mosaics, homegardens, and swiddens, illustrating its integration into Indigenous agroforestry. The plant’s presence near settlements and along paths often reflects deliberate management or facilitation for ready access to leaves for ceremonial use [7]. Outside its native range, it can be cultivated in tropical and subtropical locales under controlled conditions that simulate rainforest understory microclimates [6].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Psychotria viridis is central to the pharmacological and cosmological traditions of numerous Indigenous groups of western Amazonia, including Shipibo-Conibo, Asháninka, and many mestizo communities engaged in vegetalismo [5][7][3]. Its leaves are combined with the liana [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]] to brew [[preparations/ayahuasca]], used in ritual healing, initiation, conflict resolution, diagnosis, and divination [3][4]. Within these ceremonial frameworks, P. viridis is closely associated with “light” or visual clarity, while B. caapi is associated with “force” or grounding and somatic guidance, a phenomenological dyad frequently invoked by practitioners [4].

Key ethnobotanical features include:
- Instructional role: As a “teacher plant,” P. viridis is understood to impart knowledge, moral orientation, and ecological insight under the guidance of a healer (curandero/shaman). Ayahuasca ceremonies are embedded in ethical codes, dietary regimens, and social relations, which shape the experience and its integration into daily life [3][5][7].  
- Emic classification: Distinct local names and sub-varieties are recognized, often based on geography, leaf morphology, color, or subtle potency differences. This diversity reflects cumulative knowledge and selective propagation within lineages of practice [4][7].  
- Diaspora and syncretism: From the mid-20th century onward, the use of P. viridis within ayahuasca has moved beyond Indigenous settings into urban mestizo contexts and syncretic religious movements in Brazil, and has expanded globally through therapeutic and spiritual practices [5][7].

While P. viridis is the most widely cited DMT source in many regions, some traditions use or alternate with other admixture plants such as [[plants/diplopterys-cabrerana]] (chaliponga), which can present distinct subjective effects and dosing considerations. Selection of P. viridis versus other admixtures is often informed by lineage, territory, and ceremonial intent [4][5][7].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Principal active compound:
- N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), reported at 0.1–0.61% in dried leaf mass [4][5]. DMT is a potent serotonergic hallucinogen acting as an agonist at 5-HT2A receptors [4].

Pharmacological interaction:
- Orally ingested DMT is normally inactivated by monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the gut and liver. In ayahuasca, β-carboline alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine) from [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]] inhibit MAO-A, making DMT orally active and extending its duration. This synergy is a paradigmatic case of sophisticated Indigenous pharmacology discovered and refined through empirical tradition [4][5].

Other constituents:
- Leaves contain additional minor alkaloids and phytochemicals, but their pharmacological relevance remains under-characterized relative to DMT’s principal role [6]. Trace compounds could contribute to entourage effects, taste/visceral qualities, or subtle modulations in onset and duration reported by practitioners [4][6].

Mechanism of action and phenomenology:
- When rendered orally active in the ayahuasca matrix, DMT produces vivid alterations in visual perception, memory, and metacognition, often accompanied by introspective, emotionally salient content and somatic effects such as purgation. The ceremonial container, including songs, ritual structure, and dietary restrictions, shapes the phenomenology and perceived therapeutic outcomes [5].  
- β-carbolines contribute their own central nervous system effects (MAO-A inhibition, mild psychoactivity), and may modulate neurochemical pathways thought to support plasticity and learning. The combined pharmacology affords a time course typically longer than inhaled or injected DMT, allowing extended engagement with visionary and interpretive processes in a guided context [4][5].

Dose variability is influenced by leaf provenance, maturity, processing (fresh vs dried leaves), and brewing parameters that concentrate alkaloids. Indigenous and mestizo specialists adjust plant ratios and boil times in accordance with accumulated sensory knowledge, reported potency, and the specific aims of the ceremony [4][7].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Collection:
- Leaves are harvested at maturity, often in the early morning or aligned with ceremonial timing. Healers may differentiate sub-types of P. viridis by morphological cues (leaf luster, vein hairiness, thickness) and by perceived subjective effects, selecting accordingly [7]. In some lineages, pre-harvest prayer and dietary observance are practiced in accord with plant-spirit relationships [3][7].

Brewing:
- Fresh leaves (sometimes dried) are layered with sections of B. caapi vine and gently boiled for hours, with periodic reduction to yield a concentrated decoction. Multiple reductions or successive extractions are common, and the resulting fractions may be blended to standardize strength. While specific ratios and durations vary among lineages, the aim is a balanced preparation that harmonizes “light” (visions) and “force” (somatic grounding) [7][6].  
- Water quality, vessel material, and heat control are considered by some practitioners to influence brew character. Leaves are often hand-torn rather than chopped, and foaming and aroma are watched as indicators during the simmering process. The final brew is filtered to remove solids [6][7].

Ceremonial roles:
- Ayahuasca ceremonies are led by an experienced specialist who sets ritual protocols including dietary restrictions (dieta), abstentions, and the singing of medicine songs (icaros). Chacruna is regarded as the primary provider of visionary content, while caapi modulates the somatic and temporal frame of the experience [4].  
- Applications include healing of physical and psychological ailments, facilitation of personal insight, conflict mediation, and the transmission of ecological knowledge and community ethics across generations [4][7].  
- Preparation and serving practices reflect local cultural norms regarding who may drink (healers, patients, community members), dosage titration, and the handling of purgation and integration. Considerable emphasis is placed on the relational space created by the ceremony, which is seen as essential to the medicine’s effect [3][5][7].

Contemporary adaptations:
- In urban and international contexts, some facilitators use cultivated P. viridis leaves to stabilize supply chains and reduce pressure on wild stands. Brewing has been adapted to smaller vessels, electric heating, and standardized lot testing in some settings, though traditional specialists caution that technical standardization must not displace cultural safeguards, lineage knowledge, and ethical commitments [5][6][7].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Conservation status and pressures:
- P. viridis is listed as “least concern” by the IUCN, reflecting wide distribution and current population status [1]. Nonetheless, growing global demand for ayahuasca has amplified localized harvest pressure, especially near access points serving tourism or export markets. In some communities, practitioners report scarcity of mature plants within traditional harvesting areas, necessitating longer collection journeys or a shift toward cultivation [3][6][7].

Cultivation and propagation:
- The species can be propagated effectively via stem cuttings and seeds. For cultivation outside native habitats, partial shade, high humidity, and organic-rich, well-drained soils are recommended. Cuttings root best in warm, stable environments with careful moisture management, while seedlings benefit from shelter against direct sun and wind. These practices are increasingly promoted to support sustainable supply and reduce extraction from wild populations [6].  
- Community nurseries, living collections, and participatory propagation programs have emerged as pragmatic strategies to meet ceremonial needs while alleviating ecological pressures. In agroforestry systems, P. viridis can be intercropped under taller canopy species to mimic understory conditions [6][7].

Sustainability challenges:
- Habitat loss due to deforestation and land conversion remains an overarching threat in parts of Amazonia, contributing to reduced habitat quality and fragmentation for many understory taxa [3]. Commercialization and commodification, if unregulated or extractive, can disrupt community access and intergenerational transmission of knowledge tied to plants like P. viridis [3][6].  
- As ayahuasca practices expand beyond Indigenous contexts, supply chains may become opaque, increasing risks of overharvesting, inequitable benefit distribution, and dilution of community governance over sacred species.

Cultural rights and ethical research:
- Traditional knowledge governance and Indigenous biocultural rights are increasingly recognized in ethical research frameworks and international policy discussions, emphasizing informed consent, benefit-sharing, and protection from unauthorized commercialization [3].  
- Scholars and practitioners advocate for models that center Indigenous leadership in decision-making about cultivation, harvest protocols, and the terms under which plant materials and knowledge circulate beyond their homelands. Community-led monitoring and fair compensation mechanisms are encouraged for any commercial pathways involving P. viridis [3][6].  
- For researchers, adherence to community protocols, transparent collaboration, and data sovereignty agreements are essential components of respectful engagement. For consumers and facilitators, traceability, cultivation sourcing, and support for community initiatives can align practice with conservation and justice aims [5][6][7].
