## Abstract

**Banisteriopsis caapi**, a perennial liana of the family *Malpighiaceae*, is the principal botanical component of **ayahuasca**, a sacred brew used for millennia in the Amazon Basin for spiritual, medicinal, and divinatory purposes. The vine’s β-carboline alkaloids—primarily **harmine**, **tetrahydroharmine**, and **harmaline**—act as **monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitors**, enabling the oral activity of **N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)** from companion plants such as [[Psychotria viridis]].  

Across the Upper Amazon, *B. caapi* holds profound cultural significance among Indigenous nations including the Tukano, Shipibo-Conibo, and others. Its ceremonial use continues in both traditional and syncretic contexts, while modern pharmacological and clinical research explores its potential for mental health and neurogenesis.

**Common names:** *caapi*, *yagé*, *ayahuasca vine*, *soul vine*  
**Morphology:** A vigorous, woody climber that can reach up to 30 meters in length. Its stems are fibrous and flexible, with specialized xylem tissues that support efficient water conduction (Nagamine-Pinheiro et al., 2021). Flowers and fruit are small and inconspicuous, with morphological studies scattered primarily across ethnobotanical literature (Schultes & Hofmann, 1992).

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat

*Banisteriopsis caapi* is **endemic to the Amazon Basin**, occurring throughout **Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, and Bolivia**. It thrives in **humid lowland forests below 1,000 meters elevation**, typically growing in shaded understories where it climbs host trees for support.  

Genetic and phylogenetic studies suggest its **origin within the Western Amazon**, with both wild and semi-cultivated populations existing today (Santos et al., 2025). The plant’s propagation often occurs through vegetative cuttings, reflecting long-standing human management rather than purely wild distribution.

## Ethnobotanical Context

Within Amazonian cosmologies, *B. caapi* is revered as a **teacher plant** (*planta maestra*), an intermediary between human and spirit realms.  

Among the **Tukano (Desana)** of Colombia, the drink known as **yagé** is central to initiation, healing, and cosmological navigation (Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1971). The **Shipibo-Conibo** of Peru consider it one of their most sacred medicinal plants, used for diagnosis, energetic cleansing, and the transmission of knowledge through song (Tudela-Talavera et al., 2016).  

In mestizo traditions of **vegetalismo**, the vine is personified as a doctor or spirit guide that imparts wisdom through visionary instruction, often under prolonged dietary and behavioral discipline (*dieta*).  

Beyond Indigenous territories, *B. caapi* has been incorporated into **syncretic spiritual movements** such as Santo Daime and União do Vegetal, blending Amazonian practice with Christian and esoteric frameworks. In all settings, the vine is treated with reverence as a **sacred teacher**, aligned with the broader category of [[Teacher Plants]].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology

The principal alkaloids in *B. caapi* are **harmine**, **tetrahydroharmine (THH)**, **harmaline**, and minor constituents including **harmol** and **harmalol** (Rivier & Lindgren, 1972; McKenna et al., 1984).  

Typical total alkaloid concentration in dried stem material averages **0.4% by weight**, though levels vary with vine maturity, environment, and preparation methods (McKenna et al., 1984). Harmine commonly represents two-thirds of this profile.  

These **β-carbolines inhibit monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A)**, allowing DMT from companion plants to remain active when consumed orally. The synergistic interaction between β-carbolines and DMT underlies the **visionary effects** of ayahuasca (Ruffell et al., 2020). Emerging evidence also suggests **neurogenic** and **antidepressant properties** of harmine and related compounds (Morales-García et al., 2017).

## Traditional Preparation and Use

Preparation of ayahuasca is a **ritualized, multi-day process** passed down through generations.  
Selected sections of the vine are cleaned and pounded to loosen fibers, then boiled for several hours or days in water. The decoction is reduced to concentrate alkaloids.  

When other plants are added—commonly [[Psychotria viridis]] (*chacruna*) or *Diplopterys cabrerana* (*chaliponga*)—they are prepared separately and later combined.  

Ceremonial ingestion occurs within a structured [[Ayahuasca Ceremony]] under the guidance of an experienced **curandero**, **taita**, or **vegetalista**, accompanied by **icaros** (healing songs), rhythmic sound, and prayer. Participants observe **dietary and energetic restrictions** before and after ceremony to support physical and spiritual safety.  

The experience is understood as **a communion with the plant’s spirit**, not intoxication, and is followed by periods of integration and rest.

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations

### Ecological Sustainability
Deforestation and unsustainable harvesting pose major threats to wild populations. Responsible harvesters cut sections without uprooting the vine, enabling regeneration (Sánchez et al., 2015). Initiatives across Peru, Colombia, and Brazil now emphasize **community-based cultivation**, **seed banking**, and **forest restoration** to preserve genetic diversity.

### Cultural and Intellectual Ethics
Beyond ecology, *B. caapi* represents **intangible cultural heritage**. Its global popularity through retreat tourism raises complex issues: cultural appropriation, unequal profit distribution, and dilution of traditional knowledge systems.  

Ethical engagement requires **respect for Indigenous sovereignty**, **consent-based collaboration**, and **benefit-sharing** with the communities that have safeguarded this knowledge for millennia (Chacruna Institute for Psychedelic Plant Research).  

The Yaogará Research Archive supports documentation and education that honor these principles while promoting transparency and ecological awareness in all aspects of plant use.
