## Abstract
Byrsonima crassifolia (commonly known as Nanche) is a perennial shrub native to the Neotropics, widely recognized in Amazonian and Mesoamerican ethnomedicine for its diverse pharmacological properties and cultural significance. Both the fruit and bark are employed in traditional healthcare for ailments related to the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems, and the plant holds further ceremonial value as a sacred offering. Ongoing pharmacological studies have substantiated antioxidant, hypoglycemic, and anti-inflammatory effects, underlining its potential as a sustainable resource in traditional and modern medicine (López 2022)[1]. Across its range, Nanche occupies a unique intersection of food, medicine, and ritual: the fruit is commonly eaten fresh, fermented, or preserved, while bark decoctions are used for antidiarrheal, antimicrobial, and wound-wash applications aligned with its high tannin content (Cáceres et al. 1990)[6]. Contemporary research corroborates several traditional claims, particularly antioxidant capacity linked to phenolic acids and flavonoids, and hypoglycemic effects in preclinical models (Maldini et al. 2009)[4]; (Mariutti et al. 2014)[7]; (Peraza-Sánchez et al. 2007)[8]. With broad ecological tolerance, ease of cultivation, and long-standing integration into local economies, B. crassifolia presents strong potential for community-based biocultural conservation and value-added processing (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005)[10].

## Botanical Classification
- Taxonomy:
  - Family: Malpighiaceae
  - Genus: Byrsonima
  - Species: Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) Kunth
- Morphology:
  - Growth habit: Small to medium-sized, evergreen shrub or tree reaching 3–10 m, with a tortuous trunk and dense, often rounded crown.
  - Leaves: Simple, alternate, oblong-elliptic, coriaceous, with fine pubescence on the undersides; margins entire; petioles short.
  - Flowers: Small, yellow, arranged in terminal racemes; five petals; nectar production is attractive to insect pollinators.
  - Fruit: Globose to ovoid drupe (approximately 1–2 cm in diameter), thin yellow skin at maturity, fragrant pulp surrounding a hard endocarp; edible and aromatic.
  - Bark: Grayish to brown, thin in young stems; inner bark rich in tannins, commonly harvested for decoctions.
  - Reproductive phenology: Flowers and fruits seasonally depending on rainfall regimes; fruiting often synchronized with the onset or peak of rainy seasons, facilitating collection for food and fermentation.

Botanically, B. crassifolia is representative of several Malpighiaceae traits, including showy racemose inflorescences and insect-mediated pollination. Its dense canopy and persistent foliage make it a characteristic component of low-stature woodlands and edges, while the deep root system supports survival in drought-prone habitats (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005)[10].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Byrsonima crassifolia is native to southern Mexico and Central America, extending through tropical South America—including Amazonian lowlands—and the Caribbean (López 2022)[1]. It is present in a broad variety of ecosystems, from seasonally dry tropical forests and savannas to secondary growth and disturbed areas, occurring up to approximately 1,800 m in elevation (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005)[10]. The species demonstrates notable ecological plasticity:

- Habitat types: Dry forests, open woodlands, savannas, and anthropogenic landscapes (field margins, fallows, homegardens) (López 2022)[1].
- Soils: Tolerant of marginal and degraded soils; often persists on well-drained substrates with moderate fertility.
- Climate: Adapted to seasonal drought; fruiting phenology aligns with regional rainfall patterns, aiding seed dispersal by birds, mammals, and humans.
- Disturbance ecology: Performs well in secondary habitats and is amenable to cultivation and agroforestry, including restoration plantings where it can provide both ecological services (e.g., pollinator resources) and food/medicine (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005)[10].

This broad environmental tolerance underpins its sustained availability in local markets and household use, as well as its potential as a candidate for climate-resilient agroecological systems.

## Ethnobotanical Context
- Traditional uses:
  - Gastrointestinal health: Bark decoctions are widely used by indigenous Mixe, Zoque, Tzeltal, and Tzotzil peoples in Mexico to treat diarrhea, dysentery, and “stomach cleansing” after childbirth (Moreno 2015, Martínez-Vázquez et al. 1999)[1].
  - Respiratory ailments: Infusions of bark, or fruit pulp, are administered for bronchitis, asthma, and common colds among Yucatec and other Mayan groups (Peraza-Sánchez et al. 2007)[1].
  - Dermatological/infectious uses: Poultices and washes for skin infections, wounds, and ulcers are reported, as well as applications for snake bites (Cáceres et al. 1990)[1].
  - Women’s health: Used to stimulate lactation, strengthen postpartum women, and treat vaginal discharge (Bernal & Correa 1998)[1].

- Foodways and nutraceutical value:
  The ripe fruit is eaten fresh, prepared as syrups, preserves, and fermented beverages, and incorporated into beverages or desserts. In several regions, macerated fruit is consumed for mild gastrointestinal relief and as a nutrient source rich in vitamins C and A. Culinary and medicinal boundaries are often fluid, with fruit-based drinks and decoctions taken both as food and as supportive remedies (Alves & Rosa 2007); (Peraza-Sánchez et al. 2007)[8].

- Contemporary context:
  In mestizo and urban Amazonian communities, B. crassifolia continues to be traded locally—bark for decoctions, fruit for food and remedies, and both forms for use in ceremonial offerings or “ofrendas” at altars during key life events and at the onset of the rainy season (Alves & Rosa 2007). Regional markets may feature fresh fruit, dried bark bundles, and homemade preparations, reflecting both subsistence and small-scale commercial economies.

- Cultural significance:
  The species is regarded in many Mesoamerican traditions as both medicinal and spiritually potent; fruits and bark are offered in rites of gratitude and healing, symbolizing fertility and abundance (Alves & Rosa 2007). In some settings, Nanche is combined with emblematic cultigens such as cacao and maize in altar arrangements and seasonal rituals, articulating themes of health, reciprocity, and agricultural prosperity. Such practices can be situated alongside offerings involving other culturally significant plants such as [[plants/theobroma-cacao]] and [[Zea mays]]. While not a visionary “teacher plant” in the sense of [[plants/banisteriopsis-caapi]] or other entheogens, B. crassifolia frequently accompanies ritual complexes that integrate food, medicine, and community protection.

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
- Major compounds:
  - Phenolic acids (gallic acid, ellagic acid)[1]
  - Tannins (gallotannins, ellagitannins)
  - Flavonoids (quercetin, myricetin)
  - Saponins
  - Vitamins (notably C and A; fruit pulp)

- Pharmacological activities:
  - Antioxidant: Potent free radical scavenging observed in both bark and fruit extracts, attributed to polyphenol content (Almeida et al. 2011)[1]. Extracts from pulp, peel, and seed fractions exhibit notable total phenolic content and oxygen radical absorbance capacity, with variation across extraction solvents (Mariutti et al. 2014)[7]; (Peraza-Sánchez et al. 2007)[8].
  - Antidiarrheal & antimicrobial: Tannin-rich bark inhibits bacterial/fungal growth and improves gut motility, supportive of its traditional use in gastrointestinal infections (de Souza et al. 2017). Early screenings from Guatemala reported antibacterial activity against enteric pathogens consistent with ethnomedical applications (Cáceres et al. 1990)[6].
  - Hypoglycemic: Fruit and bark preparations lower blood glucose in animal models, likely due to combined polyphenol and fiber effects (Maldini et al. 2009)[4]. These findings align with traditional use in metabolic support and as a functional food in community diets.
  - Anti-inflammatory: Extracts inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce edema in preclinical studies (Cáceres et al. 1990).

- Mechanistic considerations:
  The astringent quality of the bark decoction—traceable to hydrolyzable tannins—likely contributes to antidiarrheal effects via protein precipitation on mucosal surfaces and modulation of intestinal secretions. Flavonoids and phenolic acids may underpin antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions through radical scavenging and attenuation of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades. Saponins may contribute amphipathic interactions relevant to membrane-associated antimicrobial effects, although their specific roles in B. crassifolia remain to be fully characterized. Nutritional antioxidants and carotenoids in the fruit complement these phytochemical activities, supporting its use as a health-promoting food (Peraza-Sánchez et al. 2007)[8].

- Safety and interactions:
  No widely reported severe adverse effects are documented in the ethnomedical record; however, astringency and potential for tannin-related irritation at high doses are noted. Caution is recommended in chronic or high-concentration use, particularly in children or pregnant women, due to limited toxicological data. As with other tannin-rich preparations, timing consumption away from iron-rich meals or supplements may be prudent to avoid reduced mineral absorption. Concurrent use with hypoglycemic agents warrants monitoring due to possible additive effects inferred from preclinical data (Maldini et al. 2009)[4].

- Research gaps:
  While in vitro and animal studies substantiate antioxidant, antimicrobial, and hypoglycemic activities, controlled clinical studies remain limited. Standardization of extract preparation, chemotype profiling across eco-geographical gradients, and dose–response assessments are priorities for translation to evidence-based applications. Community-led participatory research can support culturally appropriate protocols and equitable benefit sharing (Alves & Rosa 2007).

## Traditional Preparation and Use
- Collection:
  - Bark: Harvested with care to minimize plant damage, typically from mature stems or branches. Good practice emphasizes strip-harvesting from prunable branches rather than ring-barking.
  - Fruit: Collected once bright yellow and aromatic, typically by hand. Ripeness is essential for flavor development and medicinal/culinary efficacy.

- Preparation:
  - Decoction:
    - Bark: Chopped and boiled (10–30 g per liter) for 10–15 minutes; consumed orally for diarrhea, or used as a wash for wounds. Astringent strength is adjusted by dilution; sugar or honey may be added for palatability without compromising use as a wash.
    - Fruit: Deseeded, mashed, and diluted with water or fermented into beverages; raw fruit eaten for nutrition and mild gastrointestinal relief (Alves & Rosa 2007). In some localities, fruit macerates or lightly fermented drinks are preferred in hot seasons, aligning with availability and community preference.
  - Infusions and syrups:
    - Fruit pulp can be warmed with water and sweetener to form syrups used for coughs and sore throats, consistent with respiratory applications. Refrigeration or short-term boiling extends shelf life.
  - Topicals:
    - Strong bark decoctions are cooled and applied as washes for minor skin infections, ulcers, and wound cleaning (Cáceres et al. 1990). Gauze or cloth compresses are common where running water is scarce.

- Ceremonial use:
  - Bark shavings and ripe fruit feature as altar offerings—sometimes with cacao, maize, or other “teacher plants”—during rites invoking health, agricultural prosperity, and protection of the community. Such offerings are central to both indigenous and mestizo cosmologies; technique and symbolism vary by region (Alves & Rosa 2007). Assemblages may include [[plants/theobroma-cacao]] and [[Zea mays]]; Nanche’s bright color and fragrance contribute to the sensorial dimensions of ofrendas during seasonal transitions.

- Administration:
  Oral teas and decoctions are typical for gastrointestinal and respiratory indications, with topical applications common for skin issues. Dosage and frequency depend on local tradition, age, and presentation of symptoms. Preparations for postpartum care and lactation support are generally mild infusions, reflecting caution in vulnerable periods (Martínez-Vázquez et al. 1999)[9].

- Household practice and trade:
  Dried bark bundles and preserved fruits circulate through local markets; homegarden cultivation ensures proximity to both medicine and food. Knowledge transmission often occurs intergenerationally, particularly among women specialists and midwives (Bernal & Correa 1998)[5].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
- Sustainability:
  Overharvesting of bark poses ecological risks; local guidelines increasingly encourage pruning over debarking and cultivation in home gardens or agroforestry systems (López 2022)[1]. Emphasis on using lateral branches, rotating harvest areas, and limiting the proportion of bark removed per plant reduces mortality and supports regrowth.

- Cultivation:
  B. crassifolia is relatively undemanding, adaptable to degraded or marginal soils, and exhibits drought resistance, making it suitable for restoration plantings in its native range (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005)[10]. It establishes well in mixed agroforestry with fruit trees and timber species, where it can provide seasonal nectar and fruit for wildlife while delivering household nutrition and medicine.

- Value chains and quality control:
  Development of community-based processing for dried bark, standardized decoction packets, and fruit preserves can add value while maintaining local control. Organoleptic and phytochemical quality standards—e.g., minimum soluble solids for fruit syrups or total phenolic content ranges—can be co-developed with producer associations. Such initiatives can anchor sustainable harvest incentives alongside traceability and fair pricing (Alves & Rosa 2007).

- Ethical considerations:
  - Biocultural rights: Protection of traditional knowledge is integral, particularly with commercialization of extracts or bioprospecting. Collaborative frameworks respecting indigenous copyright are critical (Alves & Rosa 2007).
  - Access and benefit sharing: Recognition of community contributions and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research or commercialization is mandated under international agreements (CBD Nagoya Protocol). Agreements should be co-designed with communities, include culturally appropriate consent processes, and outline benefit structures such as royalties, community funds, or co-ownership of brands.
  - Community governance: Participatory management plans led by knowledge holders can guide seasonal harvests, designate no-take zones for regeneration, and align bark harvest with pruning cycles for fruit production.

- Threat assessment:
  While B. crassifolia is not currently red-listed for extinction, local depletion is possible with unsustainable bark collection or habitat loss. Fire regimes, land-use conversion, and urbanization can reduce recruitment in some regions. Community participatory approaches to management offer promising models, combining cultivation, rotational bark harvest, and market incentives for fruit-based products over raw bark. Integration into restoration projects can support landscape connectivity and in situ conservation of genetic diversity (Pennington & Sarukhán 2005)[10]; (López 2022)[1].
