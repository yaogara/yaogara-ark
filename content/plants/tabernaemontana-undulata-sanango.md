## Abstract
Tabernaemontana undulata (commonly known as Sanango Blanco, Becchete, or Sananga) is an Amazonian shrub of substantial ethnobotanical and anthropological importance among Indigenous peoples, particularly in the upper Amazon basin. Closely related to Tabernaemontana sananho, it is employed in traditional dieta practices to cultivate patience and strength, enhance hunting capabilities, and promote psychological resilience. Its applications span medicinal, ritual, and pedagogical contexts, reflecting a complex interplay between plant pharmacology and cultural symbolism (Wallace 2008; Duke & Vásquez 1994)[1][2][5].

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae
- Clade: Angiosperms
- Order: Gentianales
- Family: Apocynaceae
- Genus: Tabernaemontana L.
- Species: Tabernaemontana undulata Vahl

Common names include Sanango Blanco (Spanish), Sananga (widely used across Western Amazonia for ocular preparations), and Becchete/Bëcchëte (Matis/Matsés). Closely allied species include Tabernaemontana sananho and Tabernaemontana rimulosa, which are often referenced in similar medicinal contexts and share a suite of indole alkaloids characteristic of the genus [2][4]. The genus Tabernaemontana is typified by the presence of milky latex, opposite leaves, and white, often fragrant salverform corollas. T. undulata is a shrub to small tree in primary rainforest that can reach several meters (commonly up to c. 10 m in favorable habitats) [1][6]. Fruits in the genus are typically paired follicles; seeds are commonly arillate, an adaptation associated with animal dispersal.

Diagnostic field traits reported for T. undulata include:
- Opposite, entire leaves with conspicuous secondary venation and a glossy surface.
- Copious white latex exuded from injured tissues, a hallmark of Apocynaceae.
- White, sometimes cream-colored flowers; corolla lobes may show gentle undulation.
- Bark and roots used ethnomedicinally; root bark is especially valued for ritual and ocular preparations [1][6].

Because multiple Tabernaemontana species circulate under overlapping vernacular names, accurate identification by experienced local specialists (healers, harvesters) is considered essential for safe and effective use [1][4][6].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Tabernaemontana undulata is native to the western and central Amazon Basin, with occurrences recorded in Peru, Brazil, and Colombia [1][6]. It favors primary rainforest habitats and is commonly associated with well-drained, non-flooded terra firme forests. Field notes and ethnobotanical reports describe the plant as occurring from lowland rainforest up to lower montane foothills, where it grows under partial shade within the understory to mid-canopy strata [1][6].

Ecologically, T. undulata displays the following tendencies:
- Preference for humid tropical climates with high annual precipitation.
- Growth in forest interiors and along mature secondary forest edges, particularly where canopy gaps afford intermittent light.
- Establishment in organic-rich soils; like many Apocynaceae, it produces latex that deters herbivory, an ecophysiological trait that may facilitate persistence in biodiverse assemblages.

Distribution overlaps with numerous Indigenous territories and contemporary extractive reserves. As with many Amazonian medicinal taxa, much of the detailed biogeography reflects traditional ecological knowledge and local naming systems rather than herbarium-centric inventories, which may undercount cryptic or vernacularly conflated species [1][6].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Within many Western Amazonian traditions, T. undulata is revered as a “teacher plant” and master healer, embedded in practices that combine medicine, pedagogy, and socialization into community cosmologies. Ethnographic accounts and community narratives document use among the Matis, Matsés, Katukina, Huni Kuin (Kaxinawá), and Yawanawá, among others [1][3][5].

Key cultural domains of use include:
- Hunting technologies of perception: Sananga eye drops are applied to improve visual acuity, contrast detection, and attentional focus in the forest, with reported effects that can persist from days to weeks. The enhanced detection of texture, movement, and subtle environmental cues is framed both as a physiological aid and as a ritual realignment with non-human intelligences of the forest [1][5].
- Dieta and character cultivation: In dieta—periods of restricted diet, isolation, and immersive engagement with a plant teacher—Sanango Blanco is used to build patience and strength, support emotional regulation, and foster psychological resilience. Healers describe the plant’s instruction as enabling learning through endurance, attentiveness, and clarity, often accompanied by dreams or visionary guidance [8].
- Cleansing and protection: Communities use sananga to clear panema, a concept encompassing bad luck, spiritual blockages, and misfortune that interfere with hunting success or overall wellbeing. In this context, sananga functions as a protective and purifying agent to restore balance [5].
- Ritual complement to ayahuasca: Ocular application is frequently integrated into healing sessions or administered before ceremonies involving the vine [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and its admixtures such as [[Psychotria viridis]], priming participants for visionary work and clearing energetic obstructions [1][5][8].

Knowledge about identification, harvesting, preparation, and dosing resides within healing lineages and is transmitted through oral traditions, apprenticeship, and ritual participation. Elders and specialized practitioners (curanderos) steward access to particular plants, regulate the timing and protocol of harvests, and oversee administration to ensure safety and efficacy within the community’s ethical framework [1][5]. The interplay of secrecy, initiation, and carefully graduated teaching ensures continuity while adapting to regional pressures of globalization and the circulation of sananga in urban wellness and retreat economies [5][8].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Tabernaemontana species are widely recognized for complex indole alkaloid profiles, including iboga-type alkaloids. Reports concerning T. undulata emphasize the presence of ibogaine, coronaridine, and voacangine as putative or characteristic constituents, aligning with patterns documented across related species in the genus [5]. While rigorous chemotaxonomic confirmation for specific populations is still limited in the publicly accessible literature, the following points summarize commonly cited pharmacological considerations:

- Iboga alkaloids: Ibogaine has been studied for neuromodulatory and analgesic properties and is being explored in Western clinical contexts for addiction treatment and neuroplasticity support. Mechanistically, ibogaine interacts with multiple receptor systems and ion channels in a dose- and context-dependent manner [5].
- Coronaridine and voacangine: These related indole alkaloids have been linked in preclinical studies to anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities. In the ethnomedical framing, such properties underpin use in wound care and rheumatic discomfort, though traditional practice integrates these effects within broader ritual and cosmological logics [5].
- Latex and phenolics: As in many Apocynaceae, latex contains a mixture of constituents that deter herbivores and may contribute to topical antimicrobial or irritant effects. Eye preparations made from root bark shavings are reputed to induce intense but transient lacrimation and burning sensations, after which users describe heightened clarity of vision and attentional sharpening [1][5].

From a pharmacological perspective, ocular administration leads to robust local effects characterized by immediate nociception, vasodilation, and tearing. Traditional specialists interpret these sensations as part of the plant’s “instruction,” facilitating both physical cleansing and symbolic opening of vision. Because ethnobotanical sourcing and preparation methods vary, composition likely differs across regions and recipes, highlighting the importance of lineage-specific protocols and careful titration [1][2][5].

It is important to note that the presence and proportions of specific alkaloids in T. undulata can be influenced by plant part, age, seasonality, and extraction method. Variability in vernacular naming can also lead to inadvertent substitution with T. sananho or other Tabernaemontana species, underlining the need for expert identification and cautious generalization about chemistry from genus-level patterns [1][4][6].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Preparation is highly ritualized and typically overseen by experienced healers who situate the work within prayers, invocations, and dietary restrictions that align the practitioner and the recipient with the plant’s spirit and with community ethics [1][2]. Core preparation pathways include:

- Ocular medicine (sananga): The outer layers of the root bark are scraped; the shavings are placed in kapok cotton and macerated with water, often river water recognized locally for its balanced mineral or tannin profile. The resulting extract is filtered and administered as eye drops using leaf droppers or other improvised pipettes [1][2]. Alternatives sometimes incorporate latex, root or trunk bark, or pith; variations are believed to fine-tune intensity and duration of effects. Application provokes a powerful stinging sensation followed by copious tearing, which practitioners interpret as clearing both physical and energetic obstructions [1][5].
- Oral decoction: Among the Matsés and neighboring peoples, root material may be decocted and ingested to promote energy, cleanse the body, or support recovery. In Pastaza (Ecuador), water extracts are reported to be consumed several times daily for up to 15 days in regimens aimed at rheumatism and wound healing [4].
- Topical applications: Latex and bark preparations are applied externally to address skin conditions, dental pain, and wounds; softened leaves (heated near fire) are used to soothe rheumatic discomfort [4].

In ritual practice, administration is embedded in an intentional container:
- Pre-ceremonial clearing: Sananga may be applied before sessions with [[Banisteriopsis caapi]], priming participants for visionary engagement and aligning perception.
- Dieta discipline: Participants undertake strict food and social restrictions, observe sexual abstinence, and maintain solitude or quiet contemplation. Dreamwork and nightly application may be prescribed, with dosing adjusted by the healer to the apprentice’s constitution and the pedagogical goals of the dieta [8].
- Invocation and song: Healers call on animal spirits and forest guardians, singing or whistling to guide the medicine and to mediate between the physical and non-physical dimensions of seeing and learning [1][5].

Safety and stewardship within traditional contexts emphasize:
- Plant identification and harvesting ethics: Selection of mature individuals, respectful cutting of root bark, and careful timing (e.g., dry season) to minimize harm and ensure regrowth [1][6].
- Preparation hygiene: Use of clean tools, filtration, and fresh preparations to reduce the risk of microbial contamination in ocular applications.
- Individual assessment: Attention to the recipient’s state (e.g., eye health, concurrent plant or pharmaceutical regimens) and careful titration of drops to modulate intensity.

As sananga circulates more widely in urban and international settings, traditional safeguards are not always maintained. Healers caution that inappropriate dosing, poor hygiene, or misidentified plant material can lead to adverse effects and that the medicine’s pedagogical and protective functions depend on ethical preparation and relational accountability [5][8].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Sustaining the biocultural integrity of T. undulata requires attention to ecology, governance, and ethics at multiple scales.

Ecological stewardship
- Habitat pressure: Deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and unsustainable extraction threaten wild populations. Although T. undulata is not widely profiled on global red lists, localized overharvesting—especially of roots—can degrade stands and reduce regeneration potential [6].
- Harvesting protocols: Community-led guidelines aim to limit root bark removal to a proportion that allows recovery, to rotate harvests across individuals and sites, and to prioritize cultivated stocks when available. Agroforestry systems that integrate T. undulata alongside food and timber species can cushion wild populations from market demand [6].
- Seed and vegetative propagation: Tabernaemontana species can be established from seed or cuttings, though seed viability and germination windows may be narrow. Encouraging on-farm propagation supports sustainable supply chains while keeping control with source communities [6].

Biocultural rights and benefit-sharing
- Intellectual sovereignty: Names, recipes, and ceremonial methods are part of living knowledge systems. Documentation and commercialization without consent can erode cultural authority and lead to misapplication or harm. Indigenous governance systems should guide how, when, and by whom sananga is shared [5][8].
- Ethical markets: Where sananga or raw material enters commerce, benefit-sharing agreements and traceability are essential. Purchasing from community-managed initiatives, with verified cultivation or low-impact harvest plans, helps align external demand with local priorities [6][8].
- Ritual context and authenticity: As sananga is adopted in non-Indigenous settings, healers emphasize the importance of context, consent, and humility. Detached from dieta and lineages, preparations may be used for intensity alone rather than learning, misrepresenting the plant’s role as a teacher and skewing expectations of outcomes [5][8].

Research ethics
- Participatory methods: Collaborative research that centers Indigenous priorities, involves co-authorship or co-ownership of data, and returns findings in accessible formats can strengthen local stewardship.
- Safety and transparency: Given variable chemistry and routes of administration, researchers and practitioners should be clear about preparation, dosing, and potential risks, avoiding clinical claims not supported by data and prioritizing harm reduction [4][8].

Ultimately, honoring T. undulata as a teacher plant means keeping its ecological home intact and upholding the ethical frameworks that give the medicine meaning and efficacy in its cultures of origin. Conservation and cultural continuity are inseparable in the Amazon, where medicines are co-produced by forests, ancestors, and contemporary practitioners [6][8].
