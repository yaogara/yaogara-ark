## Abstract
Rapé (pronounced “ha-peh”) is a sacred snuff used throughout the Amazon basin, composed primarily of powdered Amazonian tobacco (Nicotiana rustica) and various medicinal plant admixtures. The practice involves blowing the finely ground mixture into the nostrils—using specialized pipes—for ritual grounding, focus, and prayer. Among Indigenous peoples, rapé holds profound cultural, spiritual, and therapeutic significance, functioning as a medium for healing, purification, and community bonding. This entry provides an account of rapé’s ethnobotanical origins, cultural contexts, preparation, pharmacology, transmission, ethical issues, and conservation status, drawing on scholarly and Indigenous-authored sources [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10].

## Botanical Classification
Rapé is a culturally defined ritual formulation rather than a single taxon. Its botanical anchoring lies in the use of Amazonian tobacco and carefully selected plant ashes.

- Cultural/technical category: Ritual snuff (nasal insufflation)
- Principal botanical base:
  - Genus: Nicotiana
  - Species: Nicotiana rustica L. (“mapacho,” jungle tobacco) — family Solanaceae [5][6]
- Common admixtures (ash-bearing or aromatic components), lineage-dependent:
  - Tree barks and woods, notably “Tsunu” (Platycyamus regnellii, Fabaceae) [1]
  - Others as named in regional pharmacopeias, including Samauma and Pau Pereira, alongside aromatic leaves, seeds, barks, or roots selected for lineage-specific purposes [7][9]
- Delivery implements:
  - Kuripe: V-shaped self-administration pipe
  - Tepi: Long tube for administration by a ritual specialist (healer, elder) [2][3][4]

The predominance of Nicotiana rustica reflects its high alkaloid content, distinct curing and preparation traditions, and status as a “master teacher plant” within Amazonian biocultural frameworks [2][3][6].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
Rapé practices are distributed throughout the Amazonian lowlands, including present-day Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, with documented use among numerous Indigenous peoples and caboclo communities [1][2][3][4][10]. The snuff’s deep history is linked to pre-Columbian traditions of powdered botanicals and ritualized tobacco across northern South America; early colonial accounts describe medicinal and spiritual applications of powdered tobacco among Indigenous groups [2]. While rapé is fundamentally an Amazonian practice, in recent decades it has circulated globally through syncretic religious movements, neo-shamanic networks, and alternative health communities [1][3][4].

Nicotiana rustica is cultivated in forest-edge gardens, shifting fields, and homestead plots, often intercropped with food and medicinal plants. Its cultivation ranges from humid lowland rainforest margins to drier, seasonally flooded zones and anthropogenic soils, depending on lineage traditions and agronomic preferences [6]. The additional plants used for ash—such as Tsunu—are sourced from native forests, agroforestry plots, or carefully selected wild stands, often with ritual harvest protocols [1][7].

Today, rapé is present in urban centers within Amazonian countries (e.g., Acre, Amazonas, Rondônia) and has become a recognized element of intercultural exchange, with some communities formulating blends for interregional and international trade [1][3][4][10]. This expanded distribution has drawn attention to sustainable sourcing, equitable partnerships, and community-based control over naming and formulation.

## Ethnobotanical Context
Rapé’s cultural significance is extensive among Amazonian societies, including the Huni Kuin, Yawanawá, Katukina, Shawãdawa, Apurinã, Nukini, and Kuntanawa [4][10]. In these traditions tobacco is understood as a “master teacher plant” and “spirit physician,” engaged for prayer, spiritual cleansing, energetic alignment, and access to vision or insight [2][3][8]. Rapé may open or close communal gatherings, support healing and initiation rites, and mark social transitions, reinforcing shared identity and reciprocity between participants and their plant allies [2][3][4].

Two modes of administration convey social and ritual roles:
- Self-application (kuripe), enabling individual prayer, grounding, and self-regulation.
- Ceremonial administration (tepi), performed by a healer or elder who directs the intention, breath, and prayer associated with the blend [2][3][4].

Rapé is frequently used in proximity to other ritual practices, including ceremonies of [[Ayahuasca]] and associated teacher plants such as [[Banisteriopsis caapi]] and [[Psychotria viridis]], though its use is distinct and governed by its own protocols [2][3][4]. Songs, breathwork, and verbalized prayers are integral; the “blowing” is not only mechanical but intentional, activating the medicine and establishing protective and clarifying boundaries [2][3][8]. Gendered knowledge and apprenticeship structures shape mastery over plant selection, preparation, and ceremonial conduct, ensuring continuity of lineage-specific teachings [1][3].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
- Primary active constituents: Nicotiana rustica contains high levels of nicotine, generally exceeding those found in Nicotiana tabacum, alongside other tobacco alkaloids (e.g., nornicotine, anabasine, anatabine) [5][6]. The addition of alkaline plant ashes is widely understood in practice to alter the pH of the blend, promoting free-base nicotine formation and rapid nasal absorption—contributing to rapé’s immediate onset and pronounced somatic effects [1][3].
- Beta-carbolines and related alkaloids: Some rapé products may contain harmala alkaloids and beta-carbolines, reported in analyses of certain tobacco preparations and lineages, although profiles vary by blend and production method [5]. These constituents are of pharmacological interest for their potential MAO-inhibitory activity, but their presence and concentrations in non-combusted snuffs can be highly variable [5].
- Acute effects: Users commonly report rapid alertness, heightened focus, a sense of grounded presence, increased salivation, lacrimation, nasal discharge, and—at higher doses—nausea or purgative responses interpreted as cleansing [3][4][8]. Short-lived sympathetic effects (elevated heart rate, blood pressure) may occur, consistent with nicotine’s stimulant and vasoactive properties [5][6][8].
- Duration and kinetics: Onset is immediate to within seconds of insufflation, with peak effects within minutes and a generally brief arc relative to oral or smoked preparations. Residual clarity or calm may persist, attributed to both pharmacology and ritual context [3][4].
- Symbolic pharmacology: Within Indigenous hermeneutics, the “spirit of tobacco” acts as protector, cleanser, and teacher. Plant admixtures are selected for lineage-specific “qualities” (e.g., courage, resilience, dream-facilitation), and blend names encode social memory, geography, and prayer [2][3][7][8][9]. Such symbolic valences are inseparable from users’ perceived outcomes.

Cautions and considerations:
- Rapé is not considered recreational by its traditional stewards. It is used in circumscribed contexts with attention to intention, setting, and guidance [2][3][8].
- Individuals with cardiovascular conditions, nicotine sensitivity, pregnancy, or those avoiding strong stimulants may be advised to refrain or to seek culturally appropriate guidance. Practices emphasize moderation, proper posture, and post-application rest to mitigate discomfort [2][3][4].
- Interactions with other plant medicines are lineage-specific; ceremonial leaders typically determine timing and appropriateness when rapé is used alongside other teacher plants [2][3][4].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Preparation is laborious and codified, combining horticultural skill, ritual etiquette, and pharmacognostic knowledge:

1. Plant selection and harvest
   - Tobacco leaves (Nicotiana rustica) are harvested at maturity, often at specific times or with prayers. Leaves may be sun-dried or shade-cured to a desired texture and potency [6].
   - Woods and barks selected for ash (e.g., Tsunu) are harvested with attention to tree vitality and sustainability, sometimes preferring pruned branches or selected pieces rather than girdling or felling [1][7].

2. Curing and grinding
   - Dried tobacco is pounded or milled to a fine, uniform powder. Separately, selected woods are burned to clean white ash; ash is then sifted repeatedly to remove charcoal and obtain ultrafine particles [1][7][9].
   - Tobacco and ash are combined in lineage-specific ratios. The ash is considered to “open” the tobacco, shifting pH and affecting the energetic and sensory profile. Many makers recite prayers throughout to maintain the blend’s integrity [1][3][7].

3. Admixture and naming
   - Additional botanicals may be incorporated—fragrant leaves, seeds, or roots—each associated with distinct intentions and effects in Indigenous pharmacopeias [7][9]. The resulting blends carry names referencing the plant allies, the lineage, or the intended quality (e.g., focus, courage) [3][7][9].

4. Storage and handling
   - Finished rapé is kept dry in sealed containers to preserve potency and flow. Long-distance trade has prompted attention to moisture control and labeling, though standards vary [1][3][4][10].

Technique of application:
- Kuripe (self-application): The V-shaped tube is seated at the nostril and mouth; the user blows forcefully to propel the powder into one nostril, then the other. Even, measured breaths are emphasized [2][3].
- Tepi (other-administration): A ritual specialist loads the tube and delivers the snuff to each nostril with a steady, intentional blow. The exchange encodes respect and prayer, with the server’s breath considered a vector of blessing and protection [2][3][4].

Immediate responses include watering eyes, nasal clearing, and a palpable “drop” into presence. Practitioners often sit upright with a grounded posture, eyes closed, and remain in stillness to integrate sensations and insight. Vocalized prayers, songs, or breath cues may accompany the process [3][4][8]. Rapé is also used to “seal” work after other medicines, helping participants reground and close ceremony [2][3][4].

Transmission:
Knowledge of plant selection, ash making, and ceremonial conduct is typically apprenticed under elders, shamans, or lineage holders and transmitted orally within families or ritual houses [1][3]. With the globalization of rapé, some communities have developed cooperative models to retain control over blend naming, quality, and intended use, even as products circulate internationally [1][3][4][10].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Ecological sustainability
- Demand growth: The increased global demand for rapé has intensified pressure on tobacco cultivation and on specific trees harvested for ash (e.g., Tsunu), with localized risks of overharvest [1][3][4][7].
- Sustainable practice: Community guidelines emphasize selective pruning, use of deadfall when appropriate, and rotational sourcing to avoid damaging keystone or slow-growing species. Agroforestry approaches and community nurseries can reduce pressure on wild stands while improving material quality [1][3][7].
- Supply chain transparency: Documentation of species used, harvest location, and preparation practices improves traceability and supports ecological stewardship across intercultural exchanges [1][3][4].

Biocultural rights and fair exchange
- Guardianship and consent: Indigenous leaders underscore that rapé is a sacred medicine embedded in collective intellectual property, with use governed by protocols, not merely by commerce [1][3][4].
- Benefit-sharing: Ethical trade requires fair compensation, community consent, and participation in decision-making over branding, blend names, and narratives associated with specific lineages [1][3][4][10].
- Cultural integrity: Producers and intermediaries are urged to avoid mislabeling, sensational marketing, or appropriation of ceremonial language detached from community context [1][3][4]. Training offered outside the Amazon should acknowledge lineages, cite teachers, and encourage learners to respect usage boundaries.

Guidance for practitioners and researchers
- Source from community-led initiatives when possible; verify lineage attribution and consent for the use of names and symbols [1][3][4][10].
- Prioritize blends made with sustainable ash sources and clearly identified materials; ask suppliers about harvesting methods and community benefit structures [1][3][7].
- In publications and educational settings, present rapé within its Indigenous epistemologies and governance systems, foregrounding the voices of knowledge holders [1][3][6][8].

These measures aim to sustain both the ecosystems that provide rapé’s constituent plants and the living cultures that steward and interpret this medicine.
