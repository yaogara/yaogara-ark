## Abstract
Himatanthus sucuuba (Spruce) Woodson, commonly known as Bellaco Caspi, is a medicinal tree of the Amazonian lowland forests, notable for its abundant milky latex traditionally used for skin and digestive complaints. Across Indigenous and riverine communities, the latex, bark, and leaves are prepared for wounds, ulcers, inflammation, and tumorous conditions, with internal use typically restricted to very low, diluted doses due to potential toxicity [1][2][4][5]. Contemporary pharmacological studies corroborate several traditional indications, identifying iridoids (e.g., plumericin, plumeride) and triterpenes (e.g., lupeol) with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, wound-healing, and cytotoxic activities, including actions against tumor cell lines in vitro [2][4][6][8][9]. Given growing regional and extra-regional demand, sustainable harvest, cultivation, and the protection of community knowledge and benefit rights are emerging priorities [2][5][6].

## Botanical Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae  
- Clade: Angiosperms  
- Order: Gentianales  
- Family: Apocynaceae  
- Genus: Himatanthus  
- Species: Himatanthus sucuuba (Spruce ex Müll. Arg.) Woodson

Synonyms: Himatanthus lancifolius, Plumeria floribunda, Plumeria sucuuba [2].  
Common names: Bellaco Caspi, sucuuba, sucuba, janaguba, among others [1][2][3][5].

Morphology: H. sucuuba is a medium-sized, evergreen to semi-deciduous tree, typically 8–16 m in height, with a cylindrical trunk approximately 30–40 cm in diameter. Leaves are large, lanceolate, and can reach up to 30 cm long; inflorescences are terminal, with conspicuous, white, fragrant flowers. All organs exude a white, copious latex when wounded, characteristic of many Apocynaceae [4]. The bark is relatively smooth to finely fissured in mature individuals; the roots and inner bark yield latex upon incision.

Diagnostic characters: The combination of large opposite leaves, white latex, and terminal clusters of white flowers aids field recognition. As with related Himatanthus species, fruiting capsules may be paired and dehiscent; correct identification in sympatry may require attention to leaf dimensions, flower morphology, and voucher comparison due to synonymy and historical reassignments within Plumeria/Himatanthus [2][4].

Phenology: Flowering and fruiting periods vary by locality and hydrological regime. In many Amazonian settings, flowering occurs in the transition from wet to dry seasons, with latex production persistent year-round but potentially influenced by tree vigor and moisture availability [2][4].

## Geographical Distribution and Habitat
The genus Himatanthus is confined to South America, with H. sucuuba centered in the Amazon basin, including Brazil, Peru, and Colombia [2][4]. The species is locally abundant in central and western Amazonia and may persist for up to six decades in suitable habitats [2].

- Habitat types: Occupies both seasonally inundated floodplain forests (várzea) and upland, non-inundated terra firme forests, showing tolerance to seasonal flooding in parts of its range [2][4].  
- Soils and microhabitat: Occurs on alluvial, nutrient-enriched substrates along riverine corridors and on well-drained upland soils; it may colonize disturbed edges and secondary growth, suggesting moderate light tolerance and resilience after canopy openings [2].  
- Ecological notes: Latex-rich tissues may confer herbivore deterrence. The species can establish in heterogeneous light environments, from semi-shaded understory to more open mid-successional stands. Seed dispersal mechanisms are not detailed in the cited sources, but dehiscent capsules and wind or animal vectors are common in allied taxa [2][4].

Regional presence in herbal markets and household pharmacopoeias is strongest along navigable river systems, facilitating exchange between rural harvesters and urban consumers [2][5].

## Ethnobotanical Context
Indigenous and riverine (mestizo) communities across the Amazon basin have long used H. sucuuba as a versatile medicinal tree. Knowledge is transmitted through family lineages and specialist healers, and preparations are incorporated into domestic and community-level therapeutics [1][2][5].

- Latex: Fresh latex is dabbed directly onto skin lesions for ulcers, wounds, herpes, and various infections; it is also used in some contexts for snakebites. Diluted preparations—commonly one or two drops in water or cane liquor—are taken for gastric ulcers, gastritis, intestinal worms, uterine inflammation, and cancerous lesions, with strict attention to dose to minimize adverse effects [1][2][4][5].  
- Bark and leaves: Decoctions and infusions of bark (occasionally leaves) are taken for coughs, tuberculosis, anemia, arthritis, and musculoskeletal pain; topical poultices of bark or leaves are applied to inflamed swellings [1][2][5].  
- Contemporary use: Reports of efficacy in oncology patients have broadened demand beyond the Amazon, elevating its profile in urban herbal markets where latex and bark derivatives circulate. In several communities, administration—especially of latex—may include ritual prayers and dietary restrictions, reflecting a view of the plant as a morally potent medicine and, in some settings, a “teacher plant” with practical and symbolic significance [2][5].

Cultural considerations: H. sucuuba figures within local notions of “hot” and “cold” medicines, convalescent diets, and postpartum care. Its bitter, strong character is respected; lay practitioners emphasize restraint in internal dosing. While not an entheogen, its ritual framing underscores the ethical commitments and relationships that structure healing practice [2][5].

## Phytochemistry and Pharmacology
Phytochemical profile: Latex, bark, and leaves of H. sucuuba contain a suite of secondary metabolites that plausibly underlie reported activities.

- Iridoids (plumericin, plumeride): Frequently implicated in anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic (anti-tumor) effects [2][4].  
- Triterpenes (e.g., lupeol; β-dihydro-plumbericinic acid): Associated with anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties [4].  
- Phenolic acids and allied phenolics: Contribute antioxidant and antimicrobial effects [4].  
- Microbiome associates: Endophytic fungi isolated from H. sucuuba exhibit antibacterial activity, suggesting a holobiont contribution to the observed antimicrobial profile [6].

Pharmacodynamic properties:

- Anti-inflammatory activity: Extracts enriched in triterpenes and iridoids suppress inflammatory mediators in vitro and in animal models, consistent with traditional use for arthritis, swellings, and ulcers [2][4][9].  
- Wound healing: In murine models, latex accelerates dermal wound closure and tissue repair, aligning with the widespread topical use on ulcers and cuts [4].  
- Cytotoxicity/antitumor potential: Iridoid glycosides and related constituents show in vitro cytotoxicity against several tumor cell lines, though effects can extend to non-malignant cells at higher concentrations, underscoring the need for cautious dosing and further selectivity optimization [4][8].  
- Antimicrobial effects: Crude extracts and metabolites from associated endophytes inhibit bacteria relevant to skin and soft-tissue infections, supporting topical applications to infected wounds [6].  
- Antioxidant and gastroprotective rationale: Phenolic content and anti-inflammatory actions offer a plausible basis for the empiric use in gastritis and gastric ulcers; however, controlled clinical data are lacking and internal latex use carries toxicity risks [2][4][7][8].

Pharmacological scope and limitations: Evidence to date is strongest at the level of phytochemistry, in vitro assays, and small animal models [2][4][8][9]. Standardization of extract profiles remains limited, and bioavailability, metabolism, and safety in humans require systematic study before clinical adoption beyond traditional contexts. Interaction potential with common pharmaceuticals (e.g., NSAIDs, anticoagulants) has not been comprehensively evaluated; prudent avoidance or clinician oversight is advisable for concomitant use.

Toxicology and safety: As with many Apocynaceae, the latex is bioactive and potentially irritating. Reports note gastrointestinal discomfort and other adverse effects at higher oral doses; topical use on very large, open wounds is generally avoided due to concerns over local toxicity and delayed healing if overdosed [1][2][4]. Formal toxicity benchmarks are sparse; traditional practice emphasizes minimal internal dosing and stepwise titration under experienced guidance [1][2]. Pregnancy, lactation, and pediatric internal use are typically contraindicated in community guidelines absent expert supervision [1][2][7].

## Traditional Preparation and Use
Harvest and handling:

- Latex collection: Shallow, controlled incisions are made in stems or bark in the morning hours; latex is collected into a clean receptacle, used fresh whenever possible, or infrequently preserved for short-term use [1][2]. Bark-stripping is minimized to prevent girdling and mortality.  
- Topical administration: Fresh, undiluted latex is dabbed onto localized lesions—wounds, fungal infections, ulcers, or herpes sores—avoiding application to extensive open areas. Applications are repeated at intervals with monitoring for irritation [1][4].  
- Oral remedies: One or two drops of latex are diluted in water or cane liquor for stomach or intestinal complaints; higher doses are avoided because of potential gastrointestinal irritation and systemic toxicity. Courses are brief and interspersed with rest days, following local norms [1][2].  
- Decoctions and infusions: Bark (and occasionally leaves) are simmered to prepare teas for respiratory complaints (coughs, asthma, tuberculosis), anemia, arthritis, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Doses, duration, and adjuvants (e.g., honey, ginger) vary by household tradition [5].  
- Poultices: Mashed bark or leaves are applied warm to inflamed joints and swellings, with or without adjunctive bandaging [1].  
- Ceremonial protocols: In several communities, administration of H. sucuuba—especially latex—may be accompanied by prayers, song, and temporary dietary restrictions (e.g., avoidance of irritant or “hot” foods), situating its use within broader cosmologies of health and reciprocity [2][5].

Practical cautions:

- Patch-testing small areas before broader topical application.  
- Avoiding mucosal and ocular exposure; washing with clean water if accidental contact occurs.  
- Refraining from concurrent internal use with alcohol beyond traditional micro-doses unless guided by experienced practitioners, and avoiding combination with pharmaceutical anti-inflammatories without medical advice [1][2][7].

## Conservation and Ethical Considerations
Status and pressures: Although traditional, small-scale harvesting has not been linked to documented declines, rising commercial demand—particularly for latex and bark—poses risks to local populations through over-tapping and ringbarking, which can compromise tree health and increase mortality [2][5].

Sustainable management:

- Harvest guidelines: Encourage latex tapping using shallow, rotational incisions spaced temporally and spatially around the stem; avoid girdling and permit recovery intervals. Limit bark removal to narrow, vertical strips from mature trees and only when necessary for household use [2].  
- Cultivation: Support community-led nurseries and enrichment planting in agroforestry mosaics and fallows. H. sucuuba’s adaptability to both várzea and terra firme suggests potential for diversified production systems that reduce pressure on wild stands [2].  
- Market transparency: Promote traceability for urban herbal markets, including labeling of origin, plant part, and preparation method; develop community-driven quality standards that prioritize safe, low-dose preparations [2][5].

Cultural rights and benefit-sharing:

- Knowledge sovereignty: Indigenous and forest-dwelling communities hold longstanding pharmacopoeial knowledge concerning H. sucuuba. Ethical practice requires free, prior, and informed consent for research and commercialization, equitable benefit-sharing, and the protection of culturally sensitive information [2][5][6].  
- Research partnerships: Collaborative protocols should prioritize local priorities (e.g., wound care, gastrointestinal health), capacity building, and co-authorship where appropriate. Studies of endophytes and metabolite standardization should include agreements on access and benefits to custodial communities [6][8].  
- Public health integration: Where community interest exists, integration of safe, standardized preparations into primary health initiatives can be explored, with pharmacovigilance and training to minimize risks from misuse or adulteration [2][8].

Regulatory context: National and regional frameworks governing biodiversity access and traditional knowledge vary. Alignment with international norms on genetic resources and associated knowledge should be pursued, with support for community protocols that govern harvesting, trade, and research.
